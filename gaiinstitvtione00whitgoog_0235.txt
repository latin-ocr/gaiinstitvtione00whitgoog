even as res singulae these rights could be acquired for a superior by
an inferior by title of legatum that is, if they are conferrcd by
attestator on the inferior as legatarius, Vat. frag. sl.

As Hereditas includes obligations (res incorporales), active and
passive, ae well as Dominium (res corporalis), the consideration of
Obligation should, theoretically speaking, precede the consideration
of Inhcritance; in an elementary exposition like the present, how·
ever, no practical inconvenience is occasioned by postponing the con·
sideration of Obligations, while we gain by exhausting the subject of
jus in rem before proceeding to the examination of jus in personam.

We may remember that Hereditas, as well as Servitudes and
obligations, was included by the Romane under the term Res
incorporales, ξ 14. The whole division of rights, however, into
Res corporales and Res incorporales is unsatisfactory ; for, as we
have already noticed, it was only from confusion of thought that
Dominium was held to be Res corporalis; for all Rights are, really,
Res incorporales
