Having examined those inferiorities of legal capacity which con·
stituted a status, we now proceed to examine certain caasa of inca·
pacity of acting independently which, though analogoue to the former
as belonging to the sphera ol unequul rights, were not included by
the Romans under the denomination oi status. The inferiorities of
capacity in infancy, minority, tutelary wardship‚ curatel, wera

fonction was distinguished aa either exclusive administration or
concurrent interposition of authority (rem gerere et auctoritatem
interponere). Up to the age ol seven the ward was called insana, ³
