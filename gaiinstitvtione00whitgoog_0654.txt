within the limite of Ordo judiciorum. Here we find on theone hand
the class electiones legitimae, actions oi civil law, including under
one oi the wider acceptatione oi civil law actiones bonae fidei (asto
the meaning oi actio legitima, cf. Roby, l, p. 95, n. lt; and on ths
other the class of actiones praetoriae, thatisactiones ficticiae oractions

with a formula in factum concepta In the latter class the praetor, J
except so far as he abstained with a demure deference from inserting j
in the formula the formal term fora legal obligation Oportere, cer ¹
tainly exeruised the attributes oia legislator. A similar, though not ,
identioal division, as already hae been mentioned, ἐξ 103-109, comm,
was that into judicia legitima and judicia imperio continentia3 a η
division that, speaking roughly, corresponded to the functione nithe l
praetor in imperial Rome and the functione of the magistrate in tha
subject provinces. This last division, though important inite timo,
was more purely historio and occidental than the preceding: ithae
left a leee permanent impress on Roman law, andits traces are nearly t
effaccd from the compilation oi J ustinian.
(4) Interdict procedure, ae opposed to the regular mode oi litigator, ¹
is defined by Gaius by the characteristic feature that the magistrata ,
principaliter auctoritatem socom {alemoniis 'I'his feature, as we hare
now seen, was not peculiar to Interdicis: but ifwe suppose that
Interdicte were oosval with statute-process and originally iormoda
matter oi cognitio extraordinaria; and that, further, the other suh
jects of cognitio extraordinaria were then imperfectly developed; tt
⁴ such a period Interdicte would form the most signal manifestationes
magisterial auctoritates and it is perhaps to ajurist of this period
that the definition we have quoted is due. So large a power oi uc
magistrate must however have seemed, even at Rome, inconsistent
with republican liberty: moreover he would from an early tima hare
found it inconvenient to inquire himself whether his command had
been obeyed„ Hence a judex was appointed to decide this question·
and eo the interdict became merely a conditional order, dimasto
the parties, under which the judex was bound to hold a cristis
necessary, in the ordinary form, that is by actio ex sponsione or by
actio arbitraria (ξ 141), and to condemn or absolve according tohis
finding (cf. Sohm, p. 307); and in Interdict procedure, as we knowit
obedienoe to the praetor'a decree is not enforced by the praetor
himself but by ajudex, and by legal proceedings in the ordiwl ξ
iorm3 either, that is, hyan actio ex sponsione or ⁴by an actio *
'arbitraria (§ 141). Accordingly in the last period we find Interdict
procedure opposed to Oognitio extraordinaria and ranked under tlt
contradistinguished class of Jus ordinarium or Ordo judiciorum.
This the Interdict became rather a matter of jurisdictio than ol im·
