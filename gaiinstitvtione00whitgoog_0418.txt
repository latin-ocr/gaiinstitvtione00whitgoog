under the con titution of Hadrian, d 121.

(5) Solidary Intercession ie exemplified by the Mandator in the
contract called usurarum ouanrrroaruu. Here a lender gives credit
to a horrower in reliance on the representatione of the mandator,
ξ 156,·who thus is a guarantor of the horroweds solvency: when
there are several such guarantors, their liability is solidary.

(6) Other Solidary Intercessors are those informally undertaking
to pay the debt of another in cousrrruuuu nnsrrr marr. Both the
Mandator and the Constituens have Beneficium divisionis, Ood. 4,
18, 3, and Beneficium excussionis, Novella 4.

Agenoy was still undcveloped.

We must suppose a time when the Cognitor and Procurator,
whose appointment as described, 4 ξ 83, was such a simple matter,

of statute-process (legis actio), concerning which we are told: Nemo

’ theless, circumstances often preventod a principat from litigating in
person. In questions relating to ownership he might in early times
get over the difficulty and practically employ an agent by fiduciary
mancipation of the property in disputo to a third person, who would
then litigate with the adversary in the rights of his auctor, or the
person from whom he deduced his title. But in questions of Obliga·
