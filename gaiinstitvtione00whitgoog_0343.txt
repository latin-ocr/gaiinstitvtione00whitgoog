536. Originally the person entitled to the praetorian sueoeseion
was required to address a formal demand to the magistrate: but
under Justinian any signification ol intention to accept the suo-
oession was sufficient without a demand. The interval allowed

ior this signification of intention (agnitio) to a parent or ohild
of the defunot was a year, to other claimants a hundred days.
Ii a person in 1 superior order or degree omitted to signiiy hie
aeceptance in the interval allowed, the snooeesion then devolved
to the next degree or order. If the person who thus omitted to
signiiy oeoeptanoe had only apreetorian title to the succession, hie
right was entirely forfeited by the omission, but if he had 1 prior
title at oivil law he could by hereditatis petitio eviet the bonorum
possessor, who aeoordingly would have only 1 nugatory or ineffeotive
possession (sine re).
