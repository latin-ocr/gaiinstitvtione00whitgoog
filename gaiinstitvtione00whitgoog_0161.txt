any loss of rank3 for the children oi adrogatus have the same
status of filiifamilias aiter their father’e adrogation as they had
before, although in a different family. The proposition, however,
that the children of adrogatus suffer capitis minutio is not confirmed
by any other jur-ist, and Savigny supposes that the doctrine was
peculiar to Paulus, and was in fact inaccurate. Another objectiou
to the theory of Savigny, though not so serious as the opposing
authority of Paulus, ie presented bytho operation of in manum
conventio. .
When an independent woman made a coemption she undoubtedly
declined in status, as before coemption she was sui juris, and after
coemption she ie filiafamilias. But a filiafamilias who made a
coemption apparently suffered no degradation: the definitive result
of the coemption leaves her, as before, filiafamilias, and that,
apparently, without having passed through any lower stage; for
Gaius expressly says that the lex mancipii, or formula oi mancipe
tion in coemption, was not calculated to reduce the woman 1ο a
servile condition, § 123. Gaius tells us, however, that coemption
operatas a capitis minutio, 1162, without limiting the effect to the
case oi a woman sui juris. The operation oi coemption 10 produce
capitis minutio is also mentioned by Ulpian, and again without any
express limitation to the case oi an independent woman: 11, 13.
‘There is least capital diminution when both citizenship and freedom
are unimpaired, and only position in honsehold 1110 is changed, as
occurs in adoption and subjection 10 hand.’ If filiafamilias under·
went capitis minutio when she made a coemption, her case dis·
proves our theory that all capitis minutio requires degradation: but
Savigny assumes that, though in these passages there is 110 express
limitation to the case of independent women, yet this limitation
must be understood3 and there is nothing outrageous in this
supposition. ’ ⁴
While, however, these objections to the hypothesis of flavigny
are doubtless serious, on the other hand they are compensated by
legal facts which seem absolutely irreconcilable with the adverse
hypothesis, the cases of Flamen Dialis and Virgo Vestalis Gel-
lius, l, 12. ‘As soon as a veetal virgin is selected and conducted
to the shrine of Vesta and delivered to 1110 pontifices, she instanta-
