inheritance, was determined by the Sc. Pegasianum. In such cir·
cumstances hs might enter on the inheritance and deduct a fourth,
or if he chose to carry out the trust implicitly enter without making
thie deductiori. But in the latter case, as well as in the former, the
law treated him not as au heir but as a legates, which made the old
stipulatione still necessary.

However Modestinus recommended, as the safer course if the heir
declined to avail himself of his right to the fourth, that he should
feign unwillingness to accept a damnosa hereditas, and should make
a compulsory acceptancs by the order of the praetor, ξ 258, in which
case the actions are transferred in totality to the transferres by the
express provision of the Sc. Pegasianum, Dig. 36, l, 47. une
sequence of ἕξ 257, 258 seeum to indicate an intention of Gaius to
suggest that this course might be adopted.

'Phe requirement for form’a sake of a compulsory aditio and
restitutio, instead of making the hereditas vest immediately under
the will in the fideicommissarius (the course pursued by the legis·
lator in the English statute of Uses and Trusts), has already,
1 §§ lae-193, been notioed as characteristic of Roman jurisprudence.
It had this inconvenience, that it permitted the trusis to be defeated
by the death or absence, malicious (dolo malo) or involuntary, of
the heres fiduciarius No remedy was provided for this contingency
till the time ol Justinian, who enacted thatin such a case the
inheritance should vest in the fideicommissarius by mere operation
of law (ipso jure). Sancimus itaque ut sive per contumaciam
afuerit is cui restitutio imposita est, sive morte praeventus nullo
relicto successore fuerit, sive a primo fideicommissario in secundum
translatio celebrari jussa est, ipso jure utiles actiones transferantur,

quasi partiary legatae required by the Sc. Pegasianum were not
only a cumbrous machinery, but after all afforded an insufficient
security to the parties. The heir and transferres wera always in
mutual danger of one another’s insolvenoy, and an heir after trans·
forring the whole inheritance, though not fairly liable to any
molestation or vexation on account of it, might find himself with
two lawsuits on his hands: he might first be aued bytho creditore
of tho estate, and then have to recover back what he is condemned
to pay them from the transferres by suing him on the covenants of
quasi vendor and quasi vendee.

It is not surprising therefore, that Justinian abolished these
provisions of the Sa Pegasianum, and enacted that in every case
there shall be a transfer or division of actions as contemplated by
the Sc. Trebellianum, ie that the actions by or against the in·
