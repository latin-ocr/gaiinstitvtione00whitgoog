operate. But if the suus heres were born aiter the death cf the
testator, the evil would be irreparable, and the testator would die
intestato. To prevent this, the civil law made an exception to the
rule that an uncertain person cannot be instituted or disinherited,
and permitted the institution or disinheritance of any suus heres who
should be born after the death of the testator: and on the authority
of the celebrated jurist Aquilius Gallus, the inventor of a form of
acceptilationtt ξ 170), this power was extended to the institution or
disinheritance of any afterborn grandchild of the testator whose
father should die in the interval between the making of the will and
the death of the testator. Dig. 28, 2, 29 pr. Gallus sic posse
institui postumos nepotes induxit: Si lilius meus vivo me morietur,
tunc siquis mihi ex eo nepos sive quae neptis postmortem meam in
decem mensibus proximis, quibus lilius meus moreretur‚natus miserit,
heredes sunto. ‘Gallus Aquilius introduced the institution of after·
born grandchildren in the following manner: If my son die in my
lifetime, then let any grandson or granddaughter by him who may be
born after my death within ten months aiter the death of my son, be
my successor.' Such grandchildren are called Postumi Aquiliani.

In respect of the ¹suus heres born after the making of the will but
in the lifetime of the testator, the case which the civil law left to the
operation ol the general rulo, it might certainly be sometimes possible
to makesnewwillafter his birthbut it might sometimesbeimpossible
or highly inconvenient3 and accordingly the lex J unia Vellaeo, which
was probably passed at the close of the reign of Augustus, in its first
chapter permitted such sui heredes, being children of the testator, and
also grandchildren of the testator born after their father’s death in the
lifetime of their grandfather, to be instituted or disinherited. Such
children and grandchildren were called Postumi Vellaeani primi
capitis. 1n its second chapter it permitted the institution or dies
inberitance oi another class oi uncertain persons, viz. quasi-afterborn
children (postumorum loco); grandchildren, for instance, who were
bom before the making of the will, but whose acquisition of the
characteres sui heredes by the decease oi their father is subsequent
to the making ol the will.

Such grandchildren are called Postumi Vellaeani secundi capitis.

Beeides the Postumi Aquiliani, the Postumi Vellaeani primi
capitis and the Postumi Vellaeani secundi capitis, the jurist Salvius
Julianus, who systematized the Edict, established the validity of the
institution or disinheritance of a fourth class, intermediate between
the Postumi Vellaeani of the first and second chapter: grandchildren,
namely, who, like the Vellaeani oi the first chapter, were born after
the making of the grandfather's will, but who, like those of the
second chapter, were born before the death oi their father. Such
