fictitioue presumption of the testator’a lunacy and made the testator
intestate; and thus filiusfamilias vindicated his own character, though
whatever share he recovered in the intestata succession vested in his
father. of. 2 §d 152-173,c0mm. 3 Inst. 2, 18.

The right of filiusfamilias ιο sue by actio commodati or depositi
was founded on a different principle. Suppose that filiusfamilias
hed horrowed or hired a thing that he afterwards lent or deposited;
J his father, not being responsible lor his son’s debts, would not be
interested in the recovery of the thing, and therefore was not
entitlcd ιο sue the depositary or horrower: the son, however, would
be onswerable ιο the original lender or letter, and accordingly was
sllowed to sne in his own name. To avoid, however, contravening
the civil law hy sliirming almopnemry right vested in a filiusfami-
lias, he did not sue by a formula in jus concepte, i. e. of the form, si
paret oportere, ‘if the plaintiff establish a right,' but by a formula
in facturn, of the form, si paret factum esse, ‘if the plaintiff establish
a lact! Ῑι is remarkable that Gaius instances precisely the actio
commodsti and the actio depositi as having two forms, one in jus
and another in factum (4 d 47); and we may conjecture that the
latter was invented ιο ιο used under these very circumstances by
filiusnmiliae

ι. The latter periodo ot Roman law present a gradual emanci-
pation oi filiusfamilias by successive inventione of new kinds of
peculium. As early astho timeof Augustus filiusfamilias was
allowed to dispose freoly by will oi his earnings in military service,
castrense peculium, which came to be treated in sll respecto as his
individual property, except that till tho time of Justinian the rules
of intestata succeseion did not apply to it liliifamiliae in castrensi
peculio vico patrumfamiliarum fungrmtun Dig. 4, 6, 2. subsequently
to the time of Gaius, under Constantine and hie successore, the earn·
inge of filiifamilias in the civil service of the State, in holy orders, in

= tho liberal professione, wore assimilated to their eaminge in the army,

and came to be called peculium quasi castrense. Further, in the timo
ol constantine, it was also established that whatever came to the
aon from his mother or, ae the law was under Justinian, from the
maternal line, or from any source but the paternal estate (ex re
patris), should be acquired for the father, and held by him only as a
usufruct or life estate, while, subject to this, theson had the owner·
ship of it (peculium adventicium). Peculium adventicium thus
included everything acquired by the son which was not castrense
peculium, nor quasicastrense peculium, nor acquired by means oi
the iather's property (ex re patris). Only this latter peculium
derived from the paternal estate continued, under the name ol
peculium proiecticiam, subject tothsold rules, and belonged in
