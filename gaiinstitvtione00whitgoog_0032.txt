subsequently affected, which had the result of giving a more equal
distribution oi votes No precise date can be assigned for the
change ; but it has been thought not 11 be earlier then 241 s. 1.,
the year in which the number of the tribes was raised 11 thirty-five ².
The principle of the new arrangement was that the tribe was made
the basis of the voting power oi the classes. There is considerable
divergence of opinion' 11 to the method in which the centurias were
distributed over the tribes3 but, according to the more usually
’ accepted view which has been held by scholare from the seventeenth
century onwerds³, the five classes were distributed over all the
tribes in such a manner that therewere two centuries of each class-
one century of 11111111 and one of iuniores-in e single tribe. Each
class would thus have two votes in each tribe aud severity votes in
all. 'Phe total number oi centuries belonging to the five classes
would be 350, 11 which the first class would possess but seventy
