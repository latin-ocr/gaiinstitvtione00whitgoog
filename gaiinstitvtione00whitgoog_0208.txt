The three servitudes, ne prospectui officiatur, uoluminibus officiatur,
ne altius tollatur, are similar in character, but differ in their degree cl
extension. The servitus uoluminibus officiatur is not so extensive as
the servitus ne prospectui officiatur, for that may amount to an obstruc-
tion of prospect which does not cause adiminution of light, Dig. 8, 2,
15: but is wider than servitus altius non tollendi, because light may be
intercepted by other causes than buildings, by plantation, for instance,
though building is the principal means of interception.

Servitus luminum has been already notioed, §§ 1—14, comm, as
apparently identioal with jus luminis immittendi, i. a the right of
having a window in a neighbour's wall. Luminum servitute con·
stituta id adquisitum videtur ut vicinus lumina nostra excipiat,
Dig. 8, 2, 4. ‘The servitude of Lights entitles the owner ol the
dominant house to have a windcw in the wall of his servient
neighbour.’

It appears from the above explanation that the servitus luminum
and the servitus ne luminibus officiatur belong to different categorias,
for the servitus luminum, like the jus officiendi luminibus, belongs
to the categcry of jus habendi ; while the servitus uoluminibus
officiatur belongs to the category ot jus prohibendi.

t 34. Of. 3 §§ 85-87. The statement that an inheritanoe is not
mancipable may seem inconsistent with what we are afterwards told
of the testament by bronze and balance, ξ 102. There is, however,
no real inconsistency. The subject mancipated in the will by bronze
and balance, though a universitas, was not an inheritance-there was
no inheritance to mancipate, for nemo est heres viventis—but the
collective rights-familia patrimonium-of the testator.

t 38. The mode of transferring obligations may be more properly
considered hereafter, when we examine the titles by which J us in
personam originates orterminates, 3§§ 155-162, comm. Gaius glauced
at the titles to Hereditas and Obligatio because he was treating oi
Res incorporales under which they are iucluded; but he should

have abstained from discussing Obligatio because he is now dealing J
with Jus in rem, and he should have abstained from discussing ³

Hereditas because he 1s now dealing with Res singulae.
