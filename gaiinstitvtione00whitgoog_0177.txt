101· males and twelve for 1011111100, ages at which the young menifestly
continue to stand in need 01 guidauce aud protection, though
according to Roman law they were then fully competent to administer
their own property, and to dispose 01 11 by will.

ἵ Such protection was provided 101 them partly by two statutes,
³ partly by praetorian legislaticn. (r) The lex Plaetoria, or Laetoria,
l was 00 old as Plautus, who ¹about 186 n. 0. makes 0 youth exclaim:

l Lex ms perdit quinauiceuaria ; metuunt credere 0111000, Pseudolus,

³ 303. ‘The statute with its five and twenty years prevents my

¹ getting credit’ It made 0 criminal offence, and subject to a criminal

prosecutiou (judicium publicum, cic. de Nat Decr. 3, 30), what
Cicero calls circumscriptio adolescentium, De Off. 3, 15; 10. over·
reaching and circumventing persons below the age of twenty-five.
Such is Savigny’s interpretation 01 judicium publicum, Vermischte
ζ Schriften, 18. lhering 1001010100 that judicium publicum denotes
in this passage not 0011101001 prosecution but 00 actio popularis;
’10 0 civil action thatconld be instituted 1101 only by the Minor but
ἵ by 0 common Informer: and he quotes Dig. 26, 10, 1, 6 (cf. Inst.
1, 26, 3) Consequens est ut videamus vqui possunt suspectos (tutores)
postulare, et sciendum est quasi publicamesse hanc actionem, hoc est,
, omnibus 001010, Dig. 12, 2, 30, 3, where quasi publica actio means an
action similar to 00110 popularis, Geist des Romischen Rechts, 152,
j 00158, 159. Τ110011011100011011011 of a minor, like fraudulent mal·
¹ administration by 0 guardian, rendered the person convicted thereos
infamis. Δ contractor with a minor might secure himself against
1110 0011011100 01 the law, if a curator were nominated by 1110 praetor
10 advisa the minor in respect 01 the special transaction.

(a) As the lex Plaetoria was only applicable in cases 01 fraud
(1101000101110, Cic. de 0113, 15), the protection it gave 10 0110010
was inadequate: accordingly, the praetor, besides allowing 0 minor
10 set up the plea of minority when sued in 00 001100, 010010101οᾶ
10 his edict 11101 he would 'relieve minore who had been damaged
¹ in consequence 01 1001001100οο 0011 improvideuce by rescission aud
cancellation 01 the proceeding (in integrum restitutio). '1¹0 obtain
this 1011011111οε 001 necessary tc prove any fraud ou 1110 0011 01
the person who contracted with the minor.

η (3) A 001000 who wished to bring 00 action against 0 minor

could compel him to obtain from the 01001010 curator 101 the
¹ purpose of deiending 1110 particular suit3 whose office ceased es
0000 as the special litigation terminated. Marcus Aurelius, under
whom Gaius flourished, euacted that any minor who chose should
be able 10 obtain from the 0100101 0 general curator (generalis
curator), who 111011 should be charged with the general adminis-

tratiou [generalis administratio) 01 his estate, Capitolinus, 10. In
