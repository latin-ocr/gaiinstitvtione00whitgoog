THEORY OF THE LAW OF NATURE xxxvii

1 presented by the plantation system, or hythe legal theory that the
1 slave was a mere Thing (Res), a chattel, not a person. We must
¹ remember that the slave, often of an iutelligence and culture superior
tothosc ot his master, and gifted with the practica] genius and the
1 capacity for detail characteristic of the erasa was frequently an
ἶ active man of business. We must remember too that the very fact
p that he was a chattel might be employed by the law as the basis for
the theory that he was, for this very reason, an excellent Instrument
of acquisition. So essential was he to his master in his capacity of
agent that the law was forced to recognize that he could be a party
toan obligation. The obligation, it ia true, could not be called
legal3 it was only natural (Naturalis obligatio)¹; but still it was an
obligation that could benefit the master, without making that master's
condition worse'. It was necessary, however, to protect other
parties to these contracts; and the Praetor gradually created a series
osquam-habilities for the master of the trading slave. Such liabilitiee
are expressed in the actions Quod dussu, Tributoria, De Peculio, De
in Rem Verso ⁸. They were created in the interest of the master as
vell as in that of the other party to the contract ; for without these
gumntees slaveagency would have become impossible. In the
history of agency the slave plays a distinguished pa1t; and the part
that he plays is formally justified by the view that he is the
possessor of Natural Rights.

all these new influences on Roman law, although they found their
most marked expression in the edicte of tha magistrates, were also
absorbed by that Professional Jurisprudence which gives us the
other aspect of the science of Interpretation. It may have been
themora important aspect; for the tecching of the schools, and the
advice of jurisconsults, no doubt did much to stimulate and guide
theactivity of the magistrates. We are told that the intluence of
skilled lawyers was for a very long time represented by the Collega
afPontifices. Even after the publication of the Twelve Tables and
lhe revelation of the forms of Action (448, 304 ao), and during the
period when socular was becoming more and more divoroed from
religious law, the knowledge of jurisprudence was, in virtue chiefly
of the familiar fact that professione once associated are not easily
sspamted, exhibited mainly in the person of the Pontifex Maximus;
