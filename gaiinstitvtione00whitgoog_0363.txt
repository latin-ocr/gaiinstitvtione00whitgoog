111. §t 77-81.] BONORVM VENDITIO 303

debtor; or a writ of levari facias, now disused, directing him to levy
the debt out ol the personal goods of the debtor‚ and the rente and
profits of his land; or awrit of elegit, commanding him to deliver
the debtor’a goods to the creditor at an appraisement, or to put the
creditor in possession of the debtor's land, to hold until out of the
rents end profits thereof the debt is levied3 or formerly, before im·
prisonment for debt was abolished, a wrlt of capias ad satisfaciendum,
commanding him to imprison the body of the debtor until satis·
fection was made for the debt. Altera men’s body was taken in
execution, no other process could bs sued out against hie lande or
hie goods, and after his lands were seized by elegit, his body could
not be taken, but ifpart only of the debt was levied on a deri facias,
the creditor might have a capias ad satisfaciendum for the residue.
so that body and goods might be taken in execution, or land and
goods, but not both body and land. None of these remedies, we
may observe, includes the sale of the debtor's laud. In the law of
bankruptoy, on the contrary, which hes grown up in comparatiyely
modern times, the whole real ae well as persensi estate of the debtor
is transferred to the creditors’ tmstee, to be sold or otherwise dis·
posed of, for the benefit of the creditors; but the trustes, ae we
have seen, fulfils a public fonction, and is not a mere agent of the
creditore.

It is to be noticed that ordinary execution for debt and benkruptcy
are not distinctly separated from one another by Gaius, all judgment
debtors alike being liable to bonorum venditio, though competing
creditore are associated together in the realization of the debtor's
estete.

In the early law the only general form of execution was personal
(manus injectio), and when the praetor established a form of real
execution it operated, whether at the instance of one, or of several
creditore, as a transfer of the debtor's entire property to the vendes.
But in course of time, owing to the inconvenience of this kind of
execution in the case of single creditore, the practice of granting execu-
tion by which portione only of a debtor’s property could be seized
was adopted by the praetor and developed by imperial legislation.
This was called pignoris capio, which is not to be confounded
with the legis actio per pignoris cepionem, of which Gaius subse·
quently gives an account, 4 ξ 26. Α portion of the debtor'e estate
was thus seized not bytho plaintiff, as in the earlier procedure, but
by public officere (the officiales, viatores, apparitores, executores of
the magistrate), and after being detained two months to enforce
payment by way of pledge, was sold in satisfaction of the debt.
Movablee were to be seized end sold in the first instance, but, if
these were insufficient, lande might be seized and sold, Dig. 42, 1, 15.
