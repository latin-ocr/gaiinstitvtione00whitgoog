capacity of civil marriage (connubium) is (a) absolute and (b)
relative. (a) Only citizens have the absolute capacity of civil
marriage, and such Latine and aliens as ara specially privileged,
ξ 56: slaves are incapable both of civil and gentile marriage.
(t) Capacity of civil marriage is, however, always relative to another
person who forms the other party to the union. A citizen only
has connubium with a citizen or with such Latina and aliens
as are specially privileged; and, before the lex Papia Poppaea
was passed, a freebom citizen (ingenuus) had οο connubium
witha citizen by manumission (libertinus). Lege Papia cavetur
omnibus ingenuis, praeter senatores eorumque liberos libertinam
uxorem habere licere, Dig. 23, 2, 23. ‘The lex Papia permits all
freeborn citizens, except senators and their children, to marry freed·
women’

§§ 58-63. 'Phe prohibition of marriage between collateral rela-
tions, originally perhaps extended as far as there were legal names for
the relationship, i. e. as far as the sixth degree, for Tacitus mentions
that second cousins were once incapable of intermarriage, sobrinarum
diu ignorata matrimonia, Ann. 12, 63 and Livy (20, seeHermes, 4, 3⁷2),
in a fragment discovered by Krueger, expressly says that marriage
was once restricted within this limit. ‘P. Coelius patricius primus
adversus veterem morem intra septimum cognationis gradum duxit
uxerem. Ob hoo Μ. Rutilius plebeius sponsam sibi praeripi novo
exemplo nuptiarum dicens sedicionem populi concitavit adeo, ut
patres territi in Capitolium perfugerent' (cf. Karlowa, Rom. Rechtsg.,
p. 175); but though marriages within this limit may still have been
regarded as contrary to religion (fas), the law (jus) was gradually
relaxed The prohibition was subsequently reduced to the fourth
degree, i. e. to the intermarriage of first cousins (consobrini), Ulpian,
5, 6, with this restrictiori, however, that if one of the collaterale was
only removed by one degree from tha common ancestor (stipes com-
munis), he was regarded as a quasi ascendent (loco parentis) and
incapable of intermarriage at any degree: thus, a man could not
marry his brother’s or sister’s granddaughter, though only related
in the fourth degree, cod. 5, 4, 17. Degrees in the direct line were
reckoned by counting the generations or births to which a person
owed his descent from an aucestor: thus, a manis one degree from
his father, two from his grandfather: in the transverse or collateral
line, by adding the degrees which separate each collateral from the
common stock ς thus, a man is two degrees from his sister, three
from his niece.
