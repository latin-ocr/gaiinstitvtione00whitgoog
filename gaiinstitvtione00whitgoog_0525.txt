Tor the proceedings in Manus injectio cf. 3} 77, comm.

Manus injectio seems to have had two meanings:

(1) Seli-help, or redress of the plaintiff by his own aot, when the
creditor arrested the debtor privately by his own authority.

In this case the award of a magistrate (addictio) would not be
a necessary preliminary to abduction (secum ducit: but self-redress
was, aa a general remedy, only tolerated when society was very
loosely consolidated; and abductio without preceding addictio must
at an early period have become, except in particular cases, illegal.
The final blow struck by the state at Seli-help was the constitution
of the three emperors, no. 389, 3§ 209, comm.

But a creditor was entitled to arrest his debtor of his own accord,
subject to certain formalities, till a comparatively late time in case
of resistanceto in jusvocatio; Sicelviturpedemve struit, manum endo
jacito, Fragment of the Twelve Tables, Tab. 1. ‘If the defendant
on being summoned to appear before the magistrate tergiversatos or
attempts to flea, the plaintiff may proceed to Manus injectio! Ι

We may conjecture also that avoidanoe of in jus vocatio by latita·
tion or keeping house rendered a defendant liable to manus injectio.
Such is the probable explanation of two fragments of the Twelve
Tables, Tab. 1: Si in jus vocat, ito. Ni it, antestaminO, igitur em
capito. . . . Tab. 2, 3: Oui testimonium defuerit, is tertii diebus ob

portum obvagulatum ito. ‘On aservice of summons to appear before
the magistrate, if the defendant refuso obedience, the plaintiff shall
obtain attestation ol the fect, and then take him by force. In default
