omission of limitation to a year. (cf. Roby, 1, p. 462 01 seq, 2,
App. D, 1100000111ος Sohm, p. 354 01 seq.)

The interdict Unde vi only applied 10 immorables. Illud utique
in dubium non venit, interdictum hoc ad res mobiles non pertinere,
Dig. De vi 01 de vi armata, 43, 16, l, 6. ‘It is certain that this
interdict is not available in the case 01 movables’

The right 011110 defendant in 1110 ordinary interdict (quotidianum)

by which the plaintiii's possession was tainted, was apparently
deemed to he 01110101061110001101111110110111100111101010 Valentinian,
Theodosius, and Arcadius, an. 389, Ood. 8, 4, 7. ‘Whoever dares
10 seize by violence things in the, possession of the treasury 01 01
private persons without waiting 101 0 judicial order, shall restore
possession, and, 11 hc is proprietor, shall forfeit his property, if he is
not proprietor, shall forfeit the value.' In-accordance with the spirit
01 this constitution, the dispossessor was no longer allowed 10 plead
the exceptione in the old form 01 the interdict, and they are omitted
in 1110 new form which we find in the Digest: Unde tu illum vi
dejecisti aut familie tua dejecit, de eo quaeque ille tunc ibi habuit
tantummodo intra annum, post annum de eo quod ad eum quivi
dejecit pervenerit, judicium dabo, Dig. 43, 16, 1. ‘The land (01

house) whence 111011 01 thy slaves hast violeutly ejected such a one, .

and the movables which he had therein, shall be recoverable by
action within a year; after the expiration 01 0 year he shall only
recover what came into 1110 hands of the diepossessor.' That isto
say, the distinction between vis armata and vis quotidiana was no
longer recognized. For 1110 (111101011οο between the meaning of vis in
the interdicts unde 11, uti possidetis, and quod vi aut clem respectively

Although violence, armed or unarmed, was prohibited 10 be em·

yet to repel violence by violence in 1110 (10101100 01 possession was

and we may not only resist ejectment, but 01001 the 0100101, provided
