time of Gaius, however, a heres could on delatio reject an inheritance
by any informal act expressive of his intention, and the acceptanoe
or rejection of an inheritance once made was irrevocable. i 169.

Το afford an escape from the danger of accepting inheritances more
onerous than lucrative J ustinian introduced the beneficium Inventarii‚
or privilege of making an inventory, reducing the liability of an heir
who made the required inventory to the extent of the assets that came
to his hands. The inventory must be commenoed within thirty days
from notice oi the inheritance and completed in sixty other days It
must be executed in the presence of a notary (tabellarius) and the
persons interesled or three witnesses,1nst. 2, 19, 6; Ood. 6, 30, 22.

By English law the executor in every case is bound to make an
inventory, and in no case is he answerabls to the testator's creditore

§i 164-173. When a right is extinguished hy inactivity prolonged
fora certain period, as in the case of a heres after delatio who has
omitted to make cretio within the time prescribed, the period has two
modes of measurement: either every dayis counted‚ and then the
periodis called tempus continuum or only available days, days on
which activity is possible, are counted‚ and then the period is called
tempus utile. When a general rule prescribes a term, not greater
than a year, within which certain steps must be taken before a court
or judicial authority, on pain of forfeiting certain rights, such a term
must be measured as tempus utile. Such arethe rules requiring
certain suits to¹ be instituted within a year from their nativity, that
is, limiting a year for their period of prescription ; and the rule
requiring the demand of the possession of a heritage (agnitio bonorum
possessionis), whether testate or intestata, to be made, ifthe claimant
is an ascendant or descendant, within a year; if he is a stranger,
within a hundred days The demand was made in writing, addressed
to a competent magistrate, and was followed by an immediate grant de
plano in the form of a simple subscriptio, Do bonorum possessionem.
Kuntze, 856. When the step required is rendered impossible, not by
a permanent obstacle, such as iniancy, lunacy, prodigality, or juristia
personality, but by some transitory circumstance, the days on which
the action is hindered are excluded from the computation of the term.

Such hindrance fr) may relate to the person entitled, and then will
he his captivity, or his absence on public service, or his detention by
weather or illness, coupled with inability to appoint a procurator:

(2) Or, in the case of the limitation of actions, it may relate to the

γ person of the defendant: if, for instance, he is unknown, or concealed,

er absent and undefended:
