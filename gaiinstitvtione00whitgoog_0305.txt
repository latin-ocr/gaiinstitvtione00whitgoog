certain persons, cod. 6, 48. 0010011110ηο 01 Universitates are certae
personae, 101 incertae as wc might imagine from their mention in this
constitution and elsewhere, the conception of a juristic person not
being very distinctly formed bytho Roman jurists. But though, as
jur-istic persons, they were capable in general of property, yet, perhaps
from a feeling of the impolicy of the principle 01 Mortmain, they were
incapable of taking either hereditas or legatum. cf. Ulpian, 22, 5
‘Nec municipia nec municipes heredes institui possunt, quoniam in·
certum corpus 001, 01 neque cernere universi neque pro herede gerere
possunt ut heredes fianta senatusconsulto tamen concessum 001, ut
a libertis suis heredes institui possint Sed fideicommissa hereditas
municipibus restitui potest: denique hoc senatusconsulto prospectum
est’ Leo, nn. 469, made municipalities capable of taking an in-
heritance (hereditas), and by the legislation of Nerva and Hadrian all
municipalities (civitates) had 1000110 capable of taking bequests
(legatum), Ulpian, 24, 18. By J ustinian's time (lhurohes and

, Foundations as well as Municipalities had become capable of taking

an inheritance or a legacy, but not corporations generally, except by

special permission, (lod. 6, 24, 8. 1§§ 197-200, comm.

heir by 1110 civil law, yet the praetor sustained such an appointment,

take the hereditas, inst. 3, 9 pr. After J ustinian’s legislation, cod.

intestata, could not belong 10 a postumus alienus, unless he was
begotten (conceptus) in the lifetime of the heringe-leaver.

ξ 244. Dies legati cedens, or the time from which a legatee has an
interest in the legacy, contingent on the inheritance being entered
on, which in 1110 event oi his death is transmissible to his heredes,
dated, as we have seen, in the time 01 Gaius from the opening of the

, testator’s will: dies veniens, the acquisition of a legany, dates from

aditio of the heres It does not require acceptance or even know·

3 ledgs of the legacy‚ § 195. In reference to contracte these terme

mean 1110 date when an obligation vests and the date when payment

÷ may be exacted. On dies cedens an obligation is acquired: it forms

part of the creditor’s patrimony, and 10 capable of novation, cession,
acceptilation : on dies veniens or actio nata, payment may be exacted
and 10 recoverable by suit. The distinction between dies cedens and
dies veniens in obligations arises when a dies adjecta or future date
of performance is contained in 1110 lex contractus.

A right 10 a conditional legaey vested when the condition was
accomplished. Herein a conditional legacy differs from a conditional
