the incidente of Naturalizetion and Denization in English law.
Naturalization formerly only affected by act of parliament is retro·
spontive, and puts an alien in exactly the same state as if he
had been born in the kiug's ligeauce, and his son born before

the naturalization may inherit: whereas the issue of a Denizen
(an alien born who has obtained ex donatione regis letters patent
to make him an English subject) cannot inherit to him, but his
issue born after may. Blackstone.

ξς 95, 96. Before the recensiou of the text by Studemund Gaius
was supposed to have defined greater Latinity in this section as the
right whereby the magistrates of certain towns acquire the Roman
franchise along with their wives aud children, and lesser Latinity
as the right whereby the magistrates themselves acquire the Roman
franchise, but not their wives and children. The distinction made
by Gaius between these two kinds of Latinity is not found iu any
other writer (cf. note to Muirhead’s Gaius, h. 1.).

The name of a senate in a municipality was ordo decurionum
or simply ordo or curia, its members being decuriones or curiales
The office of decurio, which was at one time a caveted distinction,
became very burdensome; and in order to make it more acceptable,
privileges were from time to time attached to it, as ag. Latium
majus, and in later times legitimatio per oblationem curiae (Inst.
1, 10, 13). (Dig. 50, 2 de decurionibus.)

It is to be noticed that the jus Latii could, according to Gaius, 595,
be constitutionally granted in three ways, either by the people itself
(in Comitia), or by the senate (representing the people), or by the
Emperor(1n whom the power of the people was toagreat extent vested).
