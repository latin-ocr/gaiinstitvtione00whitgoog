nanting in their own names, was an impediment in the way oi
commeroe which was met, as we have already stated, by a double
use of sOonsensual contract, which will presently be examined, the
contract of Agency (mandatum). An Agent or mandatary stipulated
in his own name with a third person, and then assigned his right
01 action to his principal; that is, gave his principale mandate to
suein his name, but on his own account (in rem suam), 2 § 38: the
principal then sued and recovered on the stipulation as assignes of
¹ the action, that is, as mandatary of his mandatary. In the latest
period the actual mandate 01 the action was unnecessary if an
intention to assign was shown: the praetor allowing the principal
in such cases 10 sue in his own name by an actio Utilis, ie. by
0 formula perhaps containing some kind 01 Fiction, Dig. 2, l4, 16
pr, Cod. 4, 10, 1, 01. Sohm, p. 443, n. 2. Nor in respect 01 Form-
less contracta, or 0011111010 governed by Jus Gentium, was the
principle of contractual Agency more completely recognized, as
has sometimes been supposed. But 11011 Agent merely acted as
emissary (nuncius) and instrument (minister) oi his principal, that
10, communicated the intention 01 an absent principal, the principel
was himself a party 10 the obligation and acquired an immediate
right against the other contractor and incurred a direct obligation
to him: he could sue him or be sued by him in 011 10110 Directa
See § 162, comm.

Ι1 11 was desired 10 give 0 third person the right 01 suing on the

contract, it was necessary 11101 the contractor should contract as
principal, and then assign his right 01 action to the third party, but
the latter was subject 1ο the same defences, as could have been used
against the assigner, who was the contracting party. Ii he neglected
the precaution of making such assignment it followed that the third
party could not recover on such contract. Paulus, Dig. 44, 7, 11,
lays down this principle which we have already, § 100, noticed:
‘Every disposition in which 0 person 0011110010 00 principal but
attempta to entitle a third person to eus as principal (i. 0. attempts
to invest a third person with the rights 01 an immediate creditor)
is invalid: and neither by formal contractos stipulation, nor by
iormless contract of purchase and eale, nor by any other contract in
which I am principa] can I invest a third person with 1 right 10
sue in his own name' But by binding the promiser to pay a
penalty to the stipulator, if something was not rendered to the third
party, the object 01 the parties might bs secured. cf. Inst. 3, 19, 19.
Alteri stipulariut supra dictum est, nemo potest: inventae sunt
enim hujusmodi obligationes ad hoc, ut unusquisque adquirat qued
sua interest ; ceterum si alii detur, nihil interest stipulatoris. Plane
si quis velit hoc facere, poenam stipulari conveniet, ut, nisi ita
