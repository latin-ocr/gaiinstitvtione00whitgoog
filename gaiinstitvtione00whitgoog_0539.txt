bonorum emptor was the same as that used in other cases where
one person sued or was sued in the name 01 another, 1 86.

The actio Serviane here mentioned was perhaps the action brought
by the bonorum emptor when he had bought the estate 01 1 deceased
debtor and so was not the same action as the actio Serviane whereby
a person letting his land 01 hire could recover the goods of a colonus
which had been pledged as a security 101 the payment 01 rent,

§36. The date 01 the important praetorian action called actio
Publiciana, after the praetor who introduced it (Inst. 4, 6, 4), is
uncertain. A Quintus Publicius is mentioned by Cicero, pro
Cluentio, 45, as praetor in a. 0. 66 01 shortly before. 'Phe actio
Publiciana (vindicatio utilis) was, as we have seen, 2 (ξ 40-61,
comm, used by a person holding the position 01 an owner whether
as bona fide possessor or 11 having a bonitary title for the purpose
of obtaining or recovering possession. But the action might also be
available on account of its convenience to an owner ex jure Quiritium
who wished 10 be relieved 011111 necessity 01 proving his title. The
plaintiff had to prove that he acquired possession in consequence 01
some disposition (titulus, causa) such 11 emptio. His acquisition had
to be accompanied like Usucapio by bona fides, i. e. a belief that the
alienor had a power to aliene; but as the proof 01 bona fides is im·
possible, whereas the proof of mala fides is often easy, bona fides was
presumed; i. e. the burden of the proof 01 mala fides was thrown on
the defendant If the plaintiff proved his intentio the defendant
would still prevail 11 he could show that he was himself owner
(exceptio dominii), or that he had obtained usucapion possession
from some third party (1 diverso auctore), 01 that having obtained
usucapion possession from the same person as the plaintiff had
acquired from (ab eodem auctore), his acquisition was prior in point
of time. In these cases Publiciana wore the air 01 1 duplex
judicium. Savigny, Obligationsrecht, § 67. For an account 01 the
actio Publiciana, when maintained by (1) 1 bonitary owner, (a) a
bonafide possessor, see 2 §§ 40-61, comm.

'Phe form 01 the actio Publiciana that we have considered proceeds
01 the supposition 01 the accomplishment 01 1 non-accomplished
usucapio. Some writers, misled by Dig. «14, 7, 35, pr., have
imagined the existence 01 another form 01 Publiciana, which they
call contraria Publiciana or Publiciana rescissoria, proceeding on the
supposition that an accomplished usucapio had not been accom-
plished. But Savigny has shown, ξ 329, that this is erroneous: that
when arsucapion is rescinded by in integrum restitutio on account
01 Absence, the action whereby the plaintiff recovers his property
may be, according to circumstances, either an ordinary Publiciana
