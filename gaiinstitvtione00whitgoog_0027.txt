THE TWELVE TABLES xxi

magistrates, bore the military name of Tribuni. The creation oi the
Tribunate gave the Plebs a political organisation, and was the
startingpoint of that dualism which runs through the whole of the
Roman constitution-a dualism expressed in the distinction between
the Comitia oi the People and the Concilium of the Plebs, between
hex and Plebiscitum, between Magistratus Populi and Magistratus
Plebis, between the Imperium oi the one and the Sacrosanctitas oi
the other. The tribunes, however, could offer only personal assistance
to outraged individuale, and though they proved a potent ohannel
for the petitione of the Plebs as a whole, they were a very ineffective
means oi protecting the private rights of individual members of this
order. Effective protection was in any ease impossible until a fuller
light had been thrown on the question what the rights to be pro·
teeted actually were. Hence the demand for the publication oi the
principles oi the law on which the jurisdiction of the patrician

magistrates was based.

ξ 9. Unificata'ou os tte Lacu tp mesas of tte Twelve Tables. ’

'Phe story oi the creation oi the Decemvirate and the formation of
the Code oi the Twelve Tables, which has come down to usin a
highly picturesque and legendary shepe, presente us with the picture,
first oi a prolonged agitation oi ten years (462-452 n. e.) maintained
by the tribunes oi the Plebs, then of a commission sent to gain
knowledge of Hellenic codes, next of the appointment of two
successive boards oi Decemvirs for the years 451, 450 n o, and
finally of the ratification oi the Gode by the Comitia Centuriata and
oi its publication, in its eompleted form, by the consuls of 448 a o. ²
'l'he Greek iniluence on the Code2, although slight, is undeniable,
because it was unavoidable. It may not ¹have been gathered, in the
way affirmed by tradition, by the appointment of a commission to
inspect the systema of law of different Hellenic states; but it was,
u the least, an inevitable result of the prolonged influenoe of the
eiviliaation of Magna Graecia ⁸, to which Rome had been subject
from the days oi her infancy--an influence which successively
moulded her army, her coinage, her commetes and her literature·
Again no State, however sslf-oentred, could dream of undertaking
euch an enterprise as a written system of law without glancing at
similar work which had already been accompliehed by neighbouring
eities But, in spite of the fact that some of its outline and a lew oi
