been transferred from the Adversaria to the Codex. The creditor,
apparently, with the consent and by the order oi the debtor, debited
the latter with a certain 'sum in the books of the creditor (expensi-
latio). Afterwards a corresponding entry was made by the debtor in
the books of the dehtor (acceptilatio). The literal contract, however,
appears to have been complete without the latter entry.

Apparently, the true contract was the entry in the oreditor’a
book. The consent (jussus) of the debtor to this entry was neces·
sary, but not restricted to any particular iorni. The entry in the
debtor's book was evidence, but not the only admissible evidence,
that he had assented to the entry in the creditor’s book.

Theophilus, in his Greek version of the Institutas, gives the
following account of the process: ἡ οἱ literis [ἐνοχὴ] ἐστὶ τὸ παλαιὸν
χρέος τίς κοινὸν δάνειον μετασχηματιζόμενον ῥίγμοσι καὶ γράμμασι τυπικαῖς. . ..
τ’γν δι’ ταῦτα τὰ ῥήματα, ἅτινα καί τ’λίγττο καί ἐγράφετο· τοὺς ίκστον χρυσοῦς, οὓς
ἐμοὶ ἐξ olrice μισθώσεως χρεωστιῖς, σὺ ix συνθήκης καί ὁμολογίας δόσεις τῶν
οἰκείων γραμμάτων ,· εἶτα τ’ντγράφττο, ὣς ἄπο τοῦ ίνόχου ἤδη γτνομίνου ίκ τῆς
μισθώσεως, τοῦτο τὰ ρίγμστο· Ἐκ τῆς συνθήκης ὂφτίλω τῶν cirsion γραμμάτων.
Kal ἡ μὲν προτέρα τ’νοχὴ ἀπεσβέννυτο, κσινοτίρσ οἱ ίτίκτττο, Theophilus, 3, 21.
‘A literal obligation was an old debt transformed into a new ioan
ογ certain solemn words and writings The words which were
spoken and written in the register were aa follows: “ The hundred
aurei, which you owe me on account of rent, will you pay me on
the convention and acknowledgment of your own journal?'' Thon
followed, as if written bytho person indebted for rent, these words:
“I owe you that sum by the admission of my own journal''
Whereby the praexisting obligation was extinguished and a new one
orateur [From the mention of ‘solemn words’ Theophilus is
'supposed to have confounded Expensilatio, which was independent
oi spoken words, with Stipulatio accompanied hy a written record cr
oaurro]

The account of Theophilus clearly only applies to one form oi
expensilation, the transscriptio a re in personam. The use of this
kind oi transscriptio is obvious: it was a mode of converting Torm-
less contracte into Formal contracte-equitable obligations into
civil obligations: of metamorphosing claime recoverable by actions
ex bonafide, ag. conducti locati, empti venditi, which in many
points favoured the defendant, into debts recoverable by the short
and sharp remedy of the civil action of condictio, which, when
brought for certa pecunia credita, was the more formidable to a dis·
honest litigant, as it was accompanied hy sponsio poenalis, whereby
the vanquished party forfeited a third of the sum in litigation, in
addition, if he was the defendant, to the original claim, 4 § 171.
