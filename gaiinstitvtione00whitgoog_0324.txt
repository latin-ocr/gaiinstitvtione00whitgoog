codicillus is the diminutive of codex, and denotes the less im·
portant and solemn documenta or instrumente of a man of business,
a pocket-book, an agenda, acedicil; as codex denotas themora
important and formal documenta, a journal, a ledger, a will Α
codicil enabled 3 testator who had solemnly executed 3 will to add
to or modify its dispositione without the necessity oi re-execution.
It was usual in a will to ratify any prior or subsequent codicils;
a codicil, however, might exist without any will An informal will
could only take effect as 3 codicil if such was the expressed intention
of the testator. A codicil could not contain an institution or dis·
inheritance or substitution3 but it might contain a trust for the
transfer of the whole of an inheritance: and though a codieil could
not contain 3 disinheritance, yet we have seen (ἕξ 147-151, comus)
that a codicillary declarat-ion that the heir was unworthy produced
confiscation or ereption of the inheritance for indignitas A testator
could only leave a single will, for a later will revoked a fonner;
but he might leave many codicils. A codicil needed no formalities,
though J ustinian required the attestation of five witnessos, not,
however, aa an essential solemnity, but as a means of proof : for, in
the absence of five witnesses, the heir might be required to deny
the existence of a trust upon his cath, Inst. 2, 23, 12. The admission
of codicils was a departure from the rule requiring 3 unity in the
act oi testation' The concontration of his last will in a single act
disposing simultaneously of all his property was no longer required of
the testator. He now might distribute his fortune by way of legacy
in a series of fragmentary or piecemeal and unrelated dispositione.

formulary period, were of two different kinds: (1) the juridical
term or term for jurisdictio, and (2) the judicial term or term fer

(ι) 'l'he term for jurisdiction, that is, for the solemn acts of the
praetor sitting on the tribunal in his court in the comitium, was
that originally prescribed for the ancient legis actiones. The year
was divided into forty dies fasti, unconditionally allotted to juridical
proceedings, one hundred and ninety dies comitiales, available for
juridical purposes unless required for the legislative assemblies, dies
intercisi, of which certain hours were available for jurisdiction, and
sixty dies nefasti, which were absolutely unavailable for juridical
proceedings.
