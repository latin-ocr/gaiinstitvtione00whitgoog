xliv HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION

fer office, and issuing edicts as interpretatione of law, human and

divine; and, important as they are, they have ne direct connexion
with either 1110 Proconsulare Imperium er the Tribunicio Potestas.
Semo 011110 most imposing powers of the Princeps were dependent
on neither 01 these two sources, but were contained only in this
general Lex 3 and, as fresh prerogatives were added to the Principate,
the Lex would grew in bulk and importunae. Some development 01
this kind may account for the fact that Gaius and Ulpian both speak
of the Princeps receiving his Imperium through a Lex ¹. Such an
expression could not have been used of the early Principes ; for the
Proconsulare Imperium was received through adeoree 01 the Senate3
but it is possible that in the course 01 time the general Iax, as
enumerating the majority ef the prerogatives of the Princeps, came
to evershadew the other sources of his authority.

Since the authority of the Princeps was built up in this gradual
and unsystematio way, it is quite impossible for the modern inquirer
to determine with preeislon the sources ef the exerciseof his different
powers. But a rough estimato may be made of five distinct kinds
ef prerogativa and ef the activities flowing from each (1) With the
Imperium were connected the control of the army and the provinces,
the right of declaring war and of making treatiss, 1110 power 01
conferring Roman citizenship or Latin rights, civil and criminal
jurisdiction, and the general power of legal interpretation. (2) The
Tribunieian Power, besides making the Princeps sacrosanct, gave
him the right, exercised during the earlier period of the Principate
but afterwards neglected, cf initiating messuras in the Assombly of
the Plebs, and also the right 01 transacting business with the Senste,
although this second right was extended by special grants. The
power of veto, inherent in the Tribunicia Potestas, gave the Princeps
a control ever all the other magistrates 01 the State, enabled him to
exercise ever the jurisdiction 01 the Senate a power akin to that of
pardon, and probably formed 1110 basis of much of his appellate
jurisdiction. (3) Two 01 the Principes, Claudius and Vespasian,
'were invested with tho temporary office of censor, and Domitian
declared himself censor for life. His example was not followed by
succeeding rulers; but the most important of the fonctions ef the
consors—the revision of the lists 01 Senaters and Knights—oontinued
to be o part 01 the admitted prerogatives 01 the Princeps Akin to
this right was that of creating Patricians, which had been conferred

¹ Gaius, i. ὅς Ulpion in Dig. l. 4. l: ‘Quod principi placuit, legis habet
vigorem 3 utpote eum legs rogia, quae de imperiosius lata ost, populus 11 01 in
eum omne suurn imperium et potestatem conferat! It has been questioned
whether the expression lex repta was 111 vogue even in the time of Ulpian, and it
may be sn interpolation. The expression 11 found in Justinian (God. 1.17. 1. 7).
