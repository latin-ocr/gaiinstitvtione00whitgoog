tho matter to be proved; which the logical promise and which the
conclusion.

In primitive jurisprudence, when there is little direct intervention
on the part of the state with private law, the Remedy is regarded ss
the certainty; the Right, primary or sanctioning, as the matter oi
deductiori. The forms of Action, emphatically so in Statute-process
(legis actio) and to a great extent even in the Formulary system as
crystallized by statute or laid down in tho edict, were capable oi
enumeration and incapable or difficolt of multiplication; and from
the application by the courts of these forms the citizen might deduce
the list cf his legal rights and duties. 'Phe logic of ancient law
may be expressed in the maxim: Where there is a Remedy there is
a Right: 'Phara is no Right unless there is a Remedy.

she modern jurist assumes the other, the more ideal of the two
correlated terme, to be the more evident, and acts upon the converse
maxim: Where there is a Right there is a Remedy; or, Given the
Right, theRemedy follows. The action now is the dependent term:
its forms are unimportant and indefinitely variable; they are no
longer crystallizations. Ifa Right is established and no appropriate
form of action seems to exist, a new one is forthwith invented, and
its fitness to eniorce the established right is sufficient to procura its
recognition by the judicaturo. Such at least, if not opposite goals,
at which ancient and modern jurisprudence have arrived, appear to
be opposite directions in which they diverge.

Sponsio or wager between the parties to a litigetion was an in·
direct mode of submitting questions to judicial decision, which
seems to have been in use before the introduction of the formulary
system. We are left to conjecture how its classification enabled
any jurist to count four classes of action. Its principal division
seems to be into the sponsio where the pecuniary rislr was senous
and the pcnal sum important (sponsio poenalis), and the sponsio
used for the purpose oi framing an issue to be tried where the penal
sum was nominal and not actually exacted (sponsio praejudicialis).
This division of actious into four instead of two classes may possibly
have arisen from the difficulty of finding a place in the twoiold
division for interdicta and praejudicia. rho four classes of actions
which Gaius refers to would accordingly be, actio in rem, actio in
porsonam, actio per sponsionem praejudicialem, actio per spon·
sionem poenalem; but as the last form of action is regarded as being
in personam, and the actio per sponsionem praejudicialem as in rem,
Gaius prefers the twofold division. (Of. Keller, Civil Process, ξ 87,
n. 82.) According to Huschke the four classes intended are (ι) per·
sonalis actio, (a) petitoria formula, (3) in rem actio, per sponsionem
cuj us summa per ¹formulam petitur, (4) per sponsionem cujus summa
