482 DE ACTIONIBVS [russas-14.

i 39. Resides the four parts mentioned by Gaius the formula
always contained a nomination of a judex, and sometimes an ex·
ceptio, praescriptio, or arbitrium, acoessory parts which will be
prasently explained.

ξ 40. The demonstratio seems not to have occurred in real actions
nor in persona] actions in factum, but in personal actions in jus,
whether founded on contract or on delict, where the intentio was
incerta res-quidquid paret dare facere oportere-but not where
the intentio was certa, as in the condictio certi It was introduced
in order to form a basis for ''aestimatio whenever an intentio
incerta left the quantum of the condemnatio to be determined
by the judex. In actio in rem Publiciana, ξ 36, and condictio
certi„§ 55, the causa is introduced, not in Demonstratio, but as
a part of the Intentio. 1

11 the contract had a technical name (e. g. depositum, venditio) l
the demonstratio contained the name (deposuit, vendidit); if the
contract was nameless, it was described in the praescriptio, which
was a substitute for the demonstratio, by a circumlocution, and this ¹
kind of process was called agere or at a later time actio praescriptis
vorbis, 3§§ 90, 91, comm. 'I'hat a demonstratio was found in actions
ex maleficio appears from Gaius, below, 6 60, and from Paulus, as
quoted in Collatio, 2, 6. Sicut formula posita est: Quod Aulo Affers
α Numerio Negidio pagno oculo percusse eat: Illud non cogitur dicere,
dextra an sinistra, nec qua manu percussa sit. Itemsidicat infamatum
se esse, debet adjicere quemadmodum infamatus sit. Sic enim et
formula concepta est: Quod Numerius Negidius aueum mmsis Aulo
Aeaeo insectandi cauea ‘As the formula is worded: Whereas Aulus
Agerius was struck on the cheek by the fist: the plaintifi' is not
compelled to declaro whether he was struck on the right or len
cheek, or whether with the right or left hand. And if he sue for
defamation‚ he must allege the means, for so the formula is iramed:
Whereas Numerius Negidius hissed Aulus Agerius with the purpose
of defamation.'

The absence of a demonstratio in the formula of condictio certi
may be inferred from the example given by Gaius, ξ 86, and from
the assertion of Cicero, pro Roscio Comoedo, 4, that it did not
appear whether Fannius, who sued Roscius by condictio certi,
founded his claim on mutui datio, expensilatio, or stipulatio. He
could hardly have asserted this, ifthe title on which Fannius suad
had been expressed in a demonstratio. On the other hand, we hare
a praescriptio corresponding toa demonstratio in the actio ex stipu-
latu for an uncertain amount, ἐξ 136, 137. It is obvious that if

a man sues ior an indeterminate sum of money he ought to give
the defendant some further information oi the cause of action ; but
