the Praetor merely administsringthe ordinary law, and hisexercising
a quasi-legislative power in extending it meets us in several funda·
mental classificatioas of Roman jurisprudenca: ithae already been
indicated in connexion with the contrasted terms, judicia legitima
and judicia imperio continentia, ἕξ 103-109, comm, and the present

is a fitting place for again noticing some of its principal aspects. ’

(1) Statuteprocess and the Formulary system are contrasted hythe
respective predominance in each of the legislator and administrator.
In Legis actio the Legislator and the Iitigants seem alone to occupy
the scene. The Praetor is only present as master of the ceremonias,
and even as such can only utter sentences which the Legislator has
previously dictated. In the Formulary system the Praetor appears
with much larger attributes3 he seems to heve stepped in frontet
the Legislator and has taken much of the initiativo from the Suitors.
Thus, marking the respective prominenoe of the srarurn and the
saurursraaros, we might denominate the older and younger systems
as Legis sotio and Praetoris interpositio: and it is this accentuation
of the statutebook or lawgiver as opposed to the tribunale or
executive that the translation has attempted to express in offering
tha invented term statute-process as a version oi Legis actio.

(2) Both Statuteprocess and the Formula, as representing at
different periods the Ordo judiciorum or ordinary course of pro·
cedure, by which a magistrate appointed a judex to try a case,
exemplity the predominance of the lawgiver ss contrasted with that
of the magistrate, when opposed to extraordinary procedure or
cognitio extraordinaria praetoris. The latter, in which 'no judex was
appointed, the proceedings throughout being under the direct
cognitance ot the magistrate, was the appropriate procedure in
plaints between children and their parents or between patrous and
ireedmen in cases of excessive cruelty os masters toslaves, or in cases
of injury hy law occasioned by some exceptional circumstance-fraud,
violence, absence, ignorance, minority (for an account of the praetor's
extraordinary remedy ori this account by in integrum restitutio ses
1 tt 197-200, comm.)-—so exceptional that it had been overlooked 01⁸
disregarded in the rules of jus strictum respecting the validity oi
legal dispositione. Interdicts seem also to have originally belonged
to this extraordinary jurisdiction of the praetor, who intervened in
this way in the interest of public order. In most of such cases, but
3 notin all (e. g. fideicommissa, though belongIng to cognitio extra·
ordinaria, were instituted by Augustus, Inst. 2, 2³, 1), tha praetor by
his inquisition and deorse (55103-109, comm.) superseded not only
the judex but also the lawgiver, who had uttered no commands
respecting the various circumstances above enumerated

(3) The same antithesis meets us as a principle ot division even
