606 DE ACTIONIBVS [1v.55188-170.

hibeatur, possidere quoque prohiberi menifestum est, Dig. 41, 2,
52,1. Etenim videris mihi possessionis controversiam facere, qui
prohibes me uti 1101 possessione, Dig. 43, 17, 3, 2.

Sevigny holds thet No. (3) was the original application of Uti
possidetis3 and that Nos. (11111 (a) were subsequent extensione of
its employment aud due 10 jurisprudence, i. 0 the ingenuity of the
jurists: the reverse is the prevalent doctrine, Baron, 5 120.

5 163. The formula arbitraria in Unde vi must have contained the
clause, Unlese the defendant obey the judge's order of restitution;
the rest is uncertain. The analogy of the other interdicte suggests
something to the following effect: If it appear that the defendant
has disobeyed the praetor’s order to reinstate the plnintiff, then,
unless the defendant comply with the judge’s order of restitution, do
thou, judge, condemn him in 111 the damages the plaintiff shall have
sustained.

The mode of restitution would be prescribed by the judex, who
would probably require the restitution of all movablee that had been
removed though these were not mentioned in the original form 01
the inierdict, 5 154.

The jurists who considered theta defendant who desired 1 formula ἶ
arbitraria was guilty by confession 01 the delict laid to hie charge, ¹
must have supposed that the only function of the judex in this 0110
was assesement of dsmages (litis aestimatio), Dig. 9, 2, 25, 2.

1165. Huschke (Stud. des rom. Rechts 5 ll) supposes that the
sponsio on Quorum bonorum was 01 the following form: If the
praetor Quintus Caepio in 1000111100 with his edict hae granted me ,
possession of the goods left by Turpilia, and if in contravention oi ¹
his edict thou hast not restored 10 me the portion 01 those goods
which thou possessoat ss heir or as occupant, or hest fraudulently
oeased 1ο possess; dost thou promise 10 pay ms suoh and such 1 sum?
I promise. 01011111. 7, 21 . . . sponsionem illam nos sine periculo
fecere posse 3 ‘Si bonorum Turpiliae possessionem Q. Caepio praetor
01 011010 100 mihi dedit’ (cf. Lencl, 5 227, and p. 359.)

The stricti juris 101101 based on this sponsio would be followedby
another, which was doubtless called judicium Seoutorium, 5 1660.
The 111101 would probably 0011111 an intentio in iactum concepta, oi
the form: si Aulus Agerius Numerium Negidium sponsione viera
and 1 formula arbitraria such as that already described for the non·
penal procedure: Ni Numerius Negidius Aulo Agerio bona illr'
judicis arbitrio restituet, quenti 00 res erit, judex Numerium

Negidium Aulo Agerio condemna.
⁴ After the first appearance before the praetor (in jus vocatio) and
the issue of the interdici (interdictum redditum or editum) it would
be necessary to wait a certain time to 100 whether it was obeyed 01
