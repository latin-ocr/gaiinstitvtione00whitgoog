and the family 10 actual; after his death, when his descendants
have formed separate familias, all the members 01 those familias are
still 0310100, because they are members 01 01 ideal family which
once was actual; and the descendants 01 those descendants are
more remotely agnates because, though never members 01 01 actual
family, they would have been 00 11 the common ancestor had lived
for, say, 0 hundred years. Similarly the wider group 01 gentiles,
§ 17, consiste 01 persons who, it may bs supposed, would be under
the power of some long-forgotten common 01000101, 11 he were alive.

The words 01 the Twelve Tables creating title by agnation are
as follow: Si intestato moritur, cui suus heres nec escit, adgnatus
proximus familiam habeto. ‘If a man die intestata, leaving no 0011-
010000001, his nearest agnata shall have the family property!

§ 10. 0010013111ηοί, brothers or sistere 01 the same father, opposed
to uterini, brothers 01 0101010 by the same mother, are properly
included among agnatos, if they have not undergone any capitis
deminutio, being agnatee 01 the first degree; but as females were
only entitled 10 inherit by the first degree 01 03101101, 1 14, the
word ‘agnatos' was sometimes limited to denote male agnates.
Agnati autem eunt cognati virilis sexus per virilem descendentes
Paulus, Sent. Rec. 4, 8, 13. ‘Agnates are male cognates related
through males' It 10 10 be remembered that the 110 01 03101101
embraced persone who were adopted into 0 family, as well as such
natural relatione 01 00310100 00 came within ite principle .

112. If the nearest degree 01 agnates in existence omitted 10
take the inheritance, or died before acceptance, the inheritance did
not devolve 011 the next degree 01 031010ος thus the jus civile
did not admits successio graduum, as for instanceif 0 111011 died
intestata leaving a brother and a nephew, the son 01 a deceased
brother, and the surviving brother did not enter 01 the inheritance,
the right to do so did 101 pass from him to the nephew, who was
next in succession but remained vacant, no repudiation 01 hereditas
delate being it would seem possible in early law. This rule was
secrupuloue interpretation of the exact words 01 the Twelve Tables:
Si intestato moritur cui suus heres nec escit, adgnatos pmsimccs
familiam habeto. As the law of inheritance based on the Twelve
Tables found no place 1010 successio graduum, so neither did it
admit a successio ordinum. Thus if the proximus agnatus or
proximi agnati, abetained from taking the inheritance, the order
01 gentiles, which was next by civil law to that 011110 agnates, could
make no claim to it. ‘In legitimis hereditatibus successio non est.’
The abeyance 01 the inheritance arieing from these circumstances
was cut short by usucapio pro herede, 2 §52, 810. Β11 0 more euitable
