We have seen that conditione were excluded from Expensilatio
or Literal Contract: it was their admissibility in Stipulatio that
made the latter, unlike Expensilntio, a generis or universal form of
contract: a contrsct equally applicable whatever the object that the
contractors desired to secure. Primitive jurisprudence, as we have
notioed, only recognized stipulatione, whose object was a dare or
conveyance of property; not stipulatione whose object was a fecere
or non-facere, some other lrind oi performance or forbearance. But
when facere or non-facere was allowed to form the condition of an
obligeti0n‚ whose object was a dare, and so, when the payment ol
a penalty could be made contingent on the performance or non·
performance ol a certain act, it became possible to stipulate, virtually
or indirectly at least, for facere or non-faeere as well as for dare.
Inst 3, 15, 7. Non solum resin stipulatum deduci possunt, sed
etiam lacta: ut ei stipulemur fieri aliquid vel non fieri. Et in hujus·
modi stipulationibus optimum erit poenam subicere, ne quantitas

intersit ; itaque si quis ut fiat aliquid stipuletur, ita adici poena debete
‘si ita factum non erit, tum poenae nomine decem aureos darc
spondesl' sed si quaedam fieri, quaedem non fieri uns eademque
conceptione stipuletur, clausula erit hujusmodi adicienda: ‘is adversus
ee factum erit sive quid ita factum non erit, tunc poenae nomine
decem eureos dare spondest’

'Phe form of the stipulation, not being in writing or attested by
witnesses, must have been often found imperfect lor evidentiary
purposes Accordingly we find that it was not uncommon in the
time ol the classical jurists lor the parties to a stipulation to draw
up a written memorandum of its contente, called cautio, and in letor
J times, under the Byzantine Emperors, there wss sn increasing ten·
' dency to lay stress on the cautioni the stipulation rather than on the
stipulation itsell, to which the eastern pert of the empire may not
have been well accustomed. Hence we find the law on this subject
laid down by J ustinian to be, that if a written memorandum embody·
ing the terms of a stipulation is proved by the plaintiff, the pertice
are presumed to have actually entered into s stipulation unless
the defendant can show that he was absent on the day from the
place where the stipulation is said to have been entered into, Inst.

The principal peculinrity that results from the nature ol formal
contract, and so of that ol the verbal und literal contracts of Roman
law, which distinguishes them from informal contracte is, that
informal contracte are not legally valid unless the ground on
account ol which the promiscis made is shown; whereas verbal
and litersl contracte, securing by the solemnity ol their formalities
