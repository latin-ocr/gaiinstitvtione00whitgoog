lege Hostilia permissum est furti agere eorum nomine, qui apud

47, 23, 1. A popularis actio was one brought bya common informer
to recover a penalty. The informer enforced, not a private but a
public right, that is, sued as the procurator of the people; and there·

competent to prosecute in such an action. 'Po publio actions and
actions by an adsertor libertatis (see 1 ξ 17, comm) Justinian adds,
as maintainable by a representative under the old jurisprudence,

an absent neighbour was called negotiorum gestor (Inst ³, 27, 1) or
defensor, or procurator voluntarius. The employment oi a cognitor,
irom the necessity oi appointing him in the presence of the adversary
and by a certain formula, was discontinued as inconvenient, and
J ustinian only speaks of the procurator. Bethmann·Hollweg, vol. 3,
appendix 1, quotes from Symmachus the report of a case in which
the defendant objected to a procurator (exceptio invalidae procura·
tionis), and the plaintiff proved his appointment by productiori of s'
document from the praetor’s record office (ex sctis praetoriis) at a late
stage of judicial proceedings. A procurator thus appointed by
protocol was called procurator praesentis, or apud acta factus, and

was to some extent ina similar position to that of a cognitor. Keller,
