When the same right is in question it is immaterial that the
secondary object (2 § l, comm) 01 the right is different Thus,
a plaintiff claiming to be heir, who faits when he brings hereditatis
petitio for Bleckacre, cannot afterwards bring hereditatis petitio for
Whiteacre es a part 01 the seme inheritance 01 course, 11 there is
no question 01 hereditas, the difference in the object involvesa
different right 01 Ownership: and the Vindicatio by which 0 man
claime Blackacre is not burred by a previous Vindicatio in which ha
claimed Whiteacre.

Perhaps the same right maybe in question even when the primary
object, the benefit which the right immediately contemphtesis
different Thus, a plaiutiff who fails in a condictio furtiva brought
10 recover stolen property, cannot afterwards maintain an actio furti
to recover a penalty for theft We might say that the plaintiff has
a single compound right to recover his property and to recorer
a penalty, but perhaps it is more accurate to say that he has two
separate rights which, however, stand 01 tall together by neeeoeary
implication. 'Phe identity 01 the right contested is more expressly
insisted on in the legal maxim, De eadem re ne bis sit 00110, which
grounded the exceptio 101 in judicium deductae, founded on the nora·
tion of the plaintiff's original right by Litis contestatio. 'Phe maxim,
· Res judicata pro veritate accipitur, grounds the exceptio rei judicatae,
which rests on the novation 01 Litis contestatio by condemnatio or

Absolutis, 3 ξ 180 ; post litem contestatam condemnari oportere, post
condemnationem 1101110011111110001000011010. The two exceptionswsrs

substantially the same, and were pleaded in the formula by the same
terme: Quod ea ¹res in judicium ante venisset, 01. 1101101, tit xliv,

comprehensiveas extending beyond the right 10 the facts constituting
the title and their logical consequences. Bethmann·Hollweg, § 111.

Itis immaterial, namely, whether a proposition was decided as
the final question, 01 00 011 0000111101 0101110111 and immediate ground
of the final decision (ratio decidendi). Every judgment is a decisiou
not only on the ultimate issue, but by implication on all the ante
cedent pleae, not only the exception, replication, duplication (which
are not a direct answer 10 tha claim 01 the plaintiff or defendant,
being only counteractive, 1115), but also on all facts, 0. g. solutio,
acceptilatio, novatio, which run counter to the claim 01 the plaintiff
iu the intentio and so would not be expressed in a Roman formula
Thus, a plaintiff who 10110 when he sues by 1001 0011011 1010 particular
thing, or by 0 persensu action 101 0 debt, basing his claim on the
presupposition 01 his succession to 0 person deceased, cannot after
warde claim the whole succession by hereditatis petitio. Hence we
often meet with praescriptio praejudicialis, c. g. Ea res agatur si in ea
