Ibering, § 47.

In the first period of the empirc, that is, in the first three
centuries of our era, it was the polioy of the emperors to maintain
a certain show of republican institutione, end the administration
of the empire was nominally divided between the princeps or
emperor and the people as represented by the senate. Thus, at
Rome there were two sets of magistrates, the old republican
magistrates with little real power, consuls, praetore, tribunes,
quaestore, in outward form elected by the people; and the imperial
nominces with much greater real authority, under the name of
praefecti, the praefectus urbi, praefectus praetorio, praefectus vigilum,
praefectus annonae, praefectus aerario; for though nominally the
people and princeps had their separate treasuries under the name ol
aerarium and fiscus, yet the treasury of the people was not managed
by quaestore ae in the time of the republic, but by an official
appointed by the emperor. Similarly the provinces were divided
between the people and the prince, the people administering those
which were peacsful and unwarlike, the prince those which required
the presence of an army. The governor ofa province, whether of
the people or the emperor, was called Praeses Provinciae. The
Praeses of a popular province was a Pmconsul, and the chief sub·
ordinate functionariee were Legati, to whom was delegated the civil
jurisdiction, and quaestore, who exercised a jurisdiction corresponding
to that of the aediles in Rome. The emperor himself was in theory
the Proconsul of an imperial province; but the actual governor,
coordinate with the Proconsul of a senatorial province, was the
legatus Caesaris, while the financial administration and hecel juris·
diction were committed to a functionary called Procurator (laeseris,
instead of the republican Quaestor. Sometimes the same person
united the office of Procurator and Legatus, ae, for instance, Pontius
Pilnte.

§z The opinions of a jurist had originally only the weight that
was due tobis knowledge and genius3 but on the transfer of power
from the hands of the people to those of the princepe, the latter
recognized the expediency of being able to direct and inspiro the
eracles of jurisprudence; and accordingly Augustus converted the
profession of juriet into a sort of public function, giving the decisione
of certain authorized jurists the force of law, Pomponius in Dig. l, 2, 49
(cf. Inst l, 2, 8). ‘Until Augustus, the public decision of legal
questione was not a right conferred by imperial grant, but any one
