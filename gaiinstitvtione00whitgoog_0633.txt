pensatio or seteff operatas ipso jure is one which commentatore
hare been much embarrassed to explain. (Dig. 16, 2, 21 (Paulus)
Posteaquam id quod invicem debetur ipso jure compensari, ib. 4
and 10. Inst 4, 6, 30 ut actiones ipso jure minuant. Ood. 4, ³1,
14, pr. Compensationes ex omnibns actionibus ipso jure fieri
sancimus.) It is evident that compensation does not operate of
itself, but must be expresely pleaded by the defendant, if he so
chooses In actiones stricti juris, though notin actiones bonae fidei,
§j 61, 63, an exceptio had to be inserted in the formula to enable
the judex to take compensatio into account. 'Phe exceptio which in
this restricted form seems to have been first granted by a rescript of
Marcus Aurelius was peculiar in this, that its object might be not the
absolution of the defendant, but only the diminution of the condemna-
tion. Ipso jure under these circumstances can, it would seem, only
mean that if compensatio is sucoessfullypleaded, the debt is regarded
as having been pro tanto extinguished from the time when the setoff
came into existence, just as the dos would be considered to have
been diminished from the time when the impensae were incurred.
Itis probable‚ however, that by the law of J ustinian the judex had
free power of recognizing compensatio in actions of all kinds and
not only in actiones bonae fidei. Of. §j 61-68, comm, Dr. Moyle's

Exceptions are capable of various olassifications.

As a Negation of the plaintiff's right forms either what we have
called the first mode of defence or the second, according as it is
founded on a fact contemporaneous or subsequent to the plaintiff’s
title, so Exceptions rest on facts either contemporaneous or sub·
sequent to those which found the claim of the plaintiff. Examples
of contemporaneous exceptione are exceptio rei venditae ac traditae,
exceptio metus, averring that a disposition on which the plaintiff
relies was originally a valid praetorian title, or that it was a disposi-
tion originally vitiated by duress. Examples of subsequent excep·
tiona arethe exceptione rei judicatae, longi temporis possessionis,
pacti conventi de non petendo In a Negative avennent the sub·
sequent event is ground of avoidance: in an exception the subsequent
event is ground of counteraotion.

Some exceptione can only be employed by a particular defendant
(exceptio personae cohaerensjz an example of this is beneficium
competentiae, which cannot be pleaded by the debtor's eurotias or
heirs. Others, and the great majority, are available to all defendants
without distinction (exceptio rei cohaerens).

Some exceptione are only available against a particular plaintiff
(exceptio in personam). E. g. the exceptio doli, si in ea re nihil
dolo malo actoris factum est, only lies against the person by whose
