THE PRINOEPS AS A SOUROE OF LAW xlvii

The fixity oi J ulian’s edict was to be found both in ite structure aud
iu its leading principles ; in the order in which the rules ol law
were marshalled and in the general significanoe of these rules It
has been supposed that J ulian'e work was not confined to the edict
of the Praetm Urbanus, but that he dealt also with the edicte of the
Praetor Peregrinus and of the Gurule Aediles ¹. He may have
treated these edicte separately3 but the three may have been
combined in a single comprehensive work which was spoken oi as
‘'l'he Edict¹.’

By the eide of these sources oi law which survived from the
Republie stood the new authority, the Princeps. He was not
regarded as, in the strict sense, a legislative authority3 but he or his
advisere exercissd a profound influence on the growth and structure
ol law in virtue oi his power oi issuing Edicta, Decrees, Rescripts, and
llandates The Edictum of the Princeps was, like that oi the
Praetor in the Republic, teehnically an interpretation of law, but, like
the Praetor, the Princeps could supplement and alter underthe guise
cf interpretation : and his creative power, es exercised by his edietal
authority, was very great An edict ol an emperor did not necessarily
bind hie successors; but, if it had been accepted as valid by a series
of emperors, it was considered to bea part of the law, audite
subsequent abandonment hed apparently to be specified by some
definite act oi repudiarunt The Decretum was ajudgment of the
Princeps as a court of juetiee; and, unless it was rescinded in a
euoceeding reign, its validity as a precedent seems to have been
unquestioned. The Rescriptum was technirally an auswer to a letter
hy which the advice of the Princeps was eought; but the word soon
came to be used ior the Princeps’ letter (Epistola) itsell. It contained
instructions either on administrative or on judieial matters. In ite
first capacity, it was addressed to some public official subordinate to
the emperor; in its second, it was addressed either to the judge or to
the litigant It wes elicited either as an answer to the consultatiou
(Consultatio) of an official or a judge who hesitated ae to his course of
procedure, or as a reply to a petition (Libellus, supplicatio) of one of
the parties to a suit 'Phe Rescript which dealt with judicial
matters might settle a doubtful point of law by showing, or extending,
the applieation oi an existing principle to a new casa The Rescript
was the most poweriul instrument of law·muking wielded by the
Prineeps The definiteness ol its form gave the opinion au authority

¹ We hear ol the Edictum Aedilium in the Constitutione ‘Omnem' (4) and

mace (5) prefixed to the Digest.

’It is possible that the common elementa in the provincial edicte were
reduced to a system at thie time. Cf. p. xxxiii.

² Paulus (Dig. 28. 2. 26) uses the expression ‘J sm sublato edicto diri Augusti,’
*phrase which suggests something more than mere neglect.
