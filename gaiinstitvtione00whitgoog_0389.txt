period, 11110 101111 was notin use, the expression used by the classical

jurists for this remedy being not actio, but agere praescriptis verbis.
There was indeed no one action in 00011 00000, but a special one was

adapted to provide 101 supplementary 00000, which required 000, as
they arose, where none 01 the common forms 01 001100 were exactly “
applicable (Sohm, p. 399, n. 4). 'l'he action is said to 110 in factum,
because, as it did not belong 10 any regular class 01 action, the facts
