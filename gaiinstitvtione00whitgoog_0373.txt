from domestic independence to domestic dependence. Thus it
operated, 0 capitis minutio minima. Capitis minutio minima had
various 0110010 00 0 man’s rights and obligations :-

(a) As it implied 0 change of family, it entailed a loss of rights
founded on agnation, including the syvorn services 010 1100111000,
101 the 1101100 was treated in certain circumstances as a quasi agnete.

(b) It had further 0110010, which perhaps we must be contented
at the present day to regard aa merely positive and inexplicable.
Thus it extinguished any ususfructus or usus vested in the arrogatas.
This effect was abrogated by Justinian, cod. 3, 33, 16.
