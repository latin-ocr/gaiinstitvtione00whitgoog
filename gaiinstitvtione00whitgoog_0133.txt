afiliafamilias or woman alieni juris, appears from Ulpisn (4, 1): Sui
juris sunt familiar-erm suarum principes, id est paterfamiliae itemque ·
materfamiliae. (see lduirhead’s Roman Isau, App. B.)

If the wife was subject to the power of her father, she required
his sanction before she could make a coemption with herbnsband. 1f
the wife was independent of parental control, she required the
sanction of her guardians, who under the old law would have been
her nearest agnates.

Coemption was sometimes employed for other purposes than
matrimony, and was then called fiduciary coempticn. Sometimes
the intention was to extinguish the obligation of onerous sacred
ritas attached to the estate of an heiress: J ure consultorum ingenio
senes ad coemptiones faciendas interimendorum sacrorum causa re·
perti sunt, Cic. Pro Murena, 12, 5 27. ‘J uristic ingenuity invented
coemptione with ages men for extinguishing sacred rites’ Savigny
(Verm. Schr. 1, 190) gives the following conjectural explanation of
the process The obligation to the sacra belonged tc the Quiritmy
ownerehip of the universitas of the woman’s estate. This, by the
effect of coemption vested in the coempticnator, an old man ap·
proaching dissolution (senex comptionalis), with whom a fictitious
marriage was contracted, and who took the estate as universal
successor. He forthwith dismissed the woman from his manus by
remancipation and manumission: aud theu, according to covenant,
restored to her the estate in portions; thetis, released from the
ritual obligations, which only attached to ths universitas On his
death, as Quintary owner of the empty universitas, the obligation
to the rites was extinguished: for the succession (hereditas) to the
coemptionator did not pass to the woman, as she by remancipation
had ceaaed to be [such was the hypothesis of Savigny before the
discovery of Gaius. instrueted by Gaius we must rather say,as
mere fiduciary coempt ion had not the effect of making her] his
filiafamilias and sua heres vhe phrase senex coemptionalis denotes
a slave. From which it may be inferred that a slave, useless for

any other purpose, and therefore very eheap, was sometimes bought
Ἴ aud manumittsd to serve as coemptionator. In svrch a ease the

η whole transaction would be very inexpensive, if not very decorous.

This mode of getting rid of mered rites is compared by Ihering,
t 58, with the institution of a slave as heir to bear the infamy
cf bankruptcy instead oi the deceased testator, 25154. Universal

ἲ succession was an institution which Rerum law only admitted in

certain cases, 2598, including the cases of Manus and Adrogatio.
If universal succession was required for the purpose of extinguishing
'· the obligation to sacred rites attaching to the estateof sn batroso, we
might have supposed that Adrogatio would have been a lem offensive
