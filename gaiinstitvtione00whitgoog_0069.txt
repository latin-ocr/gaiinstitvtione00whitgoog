Some exemplos of direct legal changes made by early emperors
ere recorded, as the right conferred by the edict of Claudius men·
tioned in 5 ³2 c of this book. ¹
’ 'l'he words cf Gaius explaining why constitutions had the force of
law seem to be imperfect, and may be supplemented from J ustinicn,
who openly asseris for himself absolute authority: Sed et quod
principi placuit legis habet vigorem: cum lege regia, quoodo imperio
ejus leta est, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem
concessit, Inst l, 2, 6. The lex imperii, Ood. 6, 23, 6, was called in
this and in the corresponding passage of the Digest (l, 4, 1) attributed '
to Ulpicn, lex regin, in memory of the lex curiata, whereby the kinge
ἕ were invested with regal power. According to Cicero the king was
proposed by the senate and elected by the Comitia (luriete, and the
¹ election was ratified in a second assembly presided over by the king;
* eg. Numam Pompilium regem, patribus auctoribus, sibi ipse populus
2 adscivit, qui ut huc venit, quanquam populus curiatis eum comitiis
regem esse jusserat, temen ipse de suo imperio curiatam legem tulit,
η De Republ 2, 13. According to Mommsen and other modern
writers, however, the later Romen idea, that the king was elected
by the Comitio, is wrong, the lex curiata having been passed, not to
elect a king, but merely to ratify a previous election or nomination.
Alex curiata was also passed to confer on a Roman magistratus his
imperium, and similarly the Roman emperor derived some of his
powers from leges, but it secure a mistake to suppose that in the
time of the principato a single lex gave him his entire authority.
A fragment of a bronze tablet‚ on which was inscribed the lex
investing Vespseien with sovereign powers, was discovered at Rome
in the fourteenth century, end is still preserved in the (lapitol.

' ὁ 6. Huschke points out that the vacant space in the MS. before
jus probably contained a definition of Edicto

All the highcr magistrates of Rome were accustomed to issue edicts
or proclamatione. 'l'hus the consuls convoked the comitis, the army,
the cenete, by edict: the censore proclaimed the approaching census
hy edict: the aediles issued regulaticns for the market by edict:
and magistrates with jurisdiction published edicte announcing the
rules they would obserwe in the administration of justice, the
Edicts of the Praetor urbanus, Praetor peregrinus, Aediles curules
being called Edicta urbana, while the Edicts of the governors
of provinces were called Edicta provincialis. These edicte, besides
being orelly proclaimed, were written on white tablete {in albo)
end suspended in the forum: apud forum palam ubi de plano
legi possit, Probus, ‘in the forum in an open spcce where persons
