(inter praesentes), or for twenty years in his absence (inter absentes),
if he satisfied the conditione of usucapion, had, according to the
provincial edict, the plea called longi temporis praescriptio against
any action brought by the owner ior recovery, and subsequently was
himself allowed ιο recover the land, as if he were owner oi it, so
that longi temporis possessio became in later Roman law not simply
a limitatio'n oi the right oi action, but a positive title anelogous to
usucapion.

Usucapion required something beyond mers possession fora cer·
tain period; and something beyond what we hereafter call Interdict
possession, 4 §t 138-170. The conditione of possession which entitled
a possessor to appeal for the protection of his possession to the
praetor's interdict were merely that he should have de facto control
of the property, as if he were owner of it, all question oi right or
title being immaterial: nor was a mala lide any more than a bona
fide possessor extluded from this protection, unless hs had obtained
possession from the other party ιο ιιο interdict by means of violence
(vi), or clandestinely (clam), or by his permission (precario). But ιο
produce Usucapion (r) the person and thing to be acquired must be
capable oi quiritary ownership, and (2) it must not have been taken
by any one’s thsft or violente from the former owner, 5 49: so that
land not being subject to furtum was more easily acquired by
usucapion than movable property, 5 60; (3) the possession of the
usucapient must ιο based on a justa causa or titulusa ground oi
acquiring ownership, such as tradition or bequest; (4) and com·
menced with bona fides on his part, a condition which appears to
have been annexed to the law of the Twelve Tables by the inter·
pretation of the prudentes Bona fides, in the case oi titulus oi
occupancy, which ie an original mode oi acquisition, e. g. usucapio
pro derelicto, is a mistaken belief that the thing is res nullius,
has no proprietor. In the case oi derivative acquisition it is the
belief that the auctor, or person from whom the thing is derived, is
either owner or, if not owner, has a power oi disposition as agent,
guardian, mortgagee, or otherwise. Vangerow, §321. 'Phe Canon
lew requires during the whole period of such prescription the bona
fides which the civil law only requires at the inception.

J ustinian remodelled the law oi Usucapion, combining it with longi
temporis possessio. Of. Inst. 2, 6. For movables he extended the
period from one year to three years: for immovables he abolisbcd the
distinction between Italian and provincial land, and required ten
years' possession if the parties vvere domiciled in the same province,
and twenty years’ possession if they were not domiciled in the same
province. Further, he introduced a new usucapion (longissimi tem·
poris praescriptio), which was governed by less stringent conditione
