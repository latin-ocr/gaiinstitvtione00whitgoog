perty of the owner of the material continues, it is in a dormant
state since he cannot, so long as it is fixed to the land, vindicate
it, ‘quia superficies solo oedit,' § 73. The Twelve Tables, however,
allowed him the actio de tigno juncto to recover double the value.

An inseparable union sometimes produces coownership in the
whole (communio), sometimes the exclusive ownership of one of
tha parties (accessio).

When two things belonging to different owners are mixed but
neither produce a new species, nor the relation of prinoipal and
accessory, e. g. when two similar wines or metals are mixed3 or
when a new species is produced with the consent of both owners,
as when mead is produced by mixing honey and wine, electrum by
mixing gold and silver; then each owner loses his separate owner·
ship ofa part, and becomes joint owner of the whole. Inst. 2, l, 27.

When a new species is produced byoue owner without the consent
cl the other, then, according to the law as settled by J ustinian, the
exclusive ownership is vested in the producar, and the other can only
obtain redress by actio in personam for the loss of his ownership.

Further, when the mixture establishes the relation of principal
and accessory, that is, when one thing loses its independent exis·
tenca and becomes a part of the other (accessio), then the ownership
in the whole is vested in the owner of the dominant part, acces·
serium sequitur principale ; cf. Dig. 6, l, 23 Siquis rei suae alienam
rem ita adjecerit, ut pars ejus fieret, veluti siquis statuae suae
bracchium. . . adjecerit, dominum ejus totius rei effioi . . . plerique
recte dicunt. It will sometimes be aquestion which part is to be
regarded as principal and which as accessory, and the solution
does not depend on their comparative value. The Roman jurists
themselves differ sometimes, as is shown in the text, in their
application of the principle of accession, but the principle itself
seems to be that the part which maintains its previous identity
and gives the dominatiug character to the entire thing is principal,
while the part which is merged in the other and so cesses to have ,
an independent existence, is accessory, as e. g. trees of one person
planted and taking root in the land of another, are thereby entirely
incorporated in the land. So again, a fresco painted by one person
on a wall belonging to another is evidently something accessory to
the wall. The case of an independent picture is a subject of disputa
in this relation. Gaius, ἕ 78, appears to think that it ought tc bc
governed by the analogy ol a manuscript, where the property in the
writing follows the property in the paper, ξ 77. It may be said,
however, that the principle of accession does not properly apply to
a picture or to a manuscript of literary velue, since they are new
creatione, differing in character from the materiale in which they
