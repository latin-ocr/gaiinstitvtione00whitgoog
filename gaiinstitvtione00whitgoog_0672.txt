his rent (vectigal) he was irremovable. 1110 real right of the emphy-
teuta must not, however, be coniounded with his possession, 101, 1110
ownership and possession, they 010 1110 1110111101 legal relations, the
one being protected by the actio in rem, the other by a possessory
interdict. The dominus probably retained usucapionpossession by
means of the tenant.

'Phe mortgagor or pledgor had usucapion-possession, the mort
gagee or pledgee had interdictposscssion. Qui pignori dedit ad
usucapionem tantum possidet; quod ad reliquas omnes causas per
tinet, qui accepit possidet, Dig. 41, 3, 16. The mortgagee cculd
recover the pledge by actio in rem quasi Serviane or hypothecaria,
Inst. 4, 6, 7. But this is the action by which the 1001 right 01 the
mortgegec or pledges is asserted, which must be distinguished 110111
the possessor-y interdici by which his possession is protected Thus
instead 01 identilying the mortgagee’s jus in ro and his interdict-
possession, it is correct to regard his jus in re and his interdictpos
session as distinct though possibly concurrent In a hypotheca,
indeed, which is an agreement establishing a jus in re without
delivery, the mortgegee or pledgee acquired no possession. 'l'he
usucapionpossession attached to the mortgagor or pledgor by means
of the mortgagee or pledgee if possession was transferred, and this
was in the interest of the mortgagec or pledgee, whose meurity
against third persons would be strengthened through the consequent
acquisition 01 ownership by the mortgagor or pledgor.

The depositary has 111010 detention, the depositor retaining his
interdict-possession. The depositary only acquires possession in 0110
cese, thetis, when he is made a stakeholder for this very purpose.
Dig. 16, 3, 17, 1. ‘Not only the property but also the possession
01 the thing deposited remains with the depositor, except when a
thing is deposited with a stakeholder (sequester) not simply 101 sale
custody: 101111 1111001100 the sequestrator possesses, the object being
to prevent the time 01 usucapion from proceeding.’ It seems, then,
11101 111 such Sequestmtion 1110 interim usucapionpossession cannot
be counted by the victor in the suit, Dig. 41, 2, 39.

With Permissive holding of a thing (precarium) possession
pasees, unless it is expressly agreed that only detention shall pass
Meminisse autem nos oportet, eum qui precario habet etiam pomi·
dere, Dig. 43, 26, 4, 1. ‘We must remember that 1110 holder 01
a thing by permission has possession’ Is qui rogavit, ut precario
in fundo moretur, non possidet, sed possessio apud eum qui enecet
remanet, Dig. 43, 26, 6, 2. ‘He who has asked to be allowed to
romain on land merely at the will cf the owner does not pcffl
but possession 1011101110 with the grenton' The grantor always re-
tained usucapionpossession, Dig. 43, 26, 15, 4.
