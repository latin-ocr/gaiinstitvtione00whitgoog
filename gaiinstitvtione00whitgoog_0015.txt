HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION

Ir order to justiiy the character of this introductory essay it is
necessary to say a few words about the intention with which itis
written. The rsader must regard it mainly in the light oi an intro·
duotion to the Institutee of Gaius, not in the light of a disinterested
eketch of the history of Roman Law. Had it been intended to have
the latter character, bctb some of ite omissione and some of ite
inclusione would be wholly unjustifiable. The most signal of the
omissione ie the neglect tc give an adequate treatment to the stage of
Roman Low which yields to no other in importunos-the stage at
which it pasees from the religione to the secular sphera from Fae to
JUS. One oi the chief questions which is, οι· should be, agitating
· studente of Romen Law' at the present day, iethet ofthe period at
which this transition was effectsd. For, if it is true that Roman Low
retained its priestly character and its religione sanctione to a late
period of the Republic ¹, then the traditional history ol the Twelve
Tables ie an improbability, and the account given by Cicero and
other writers of the legislation and procedure of the Monarohy and
early Republic is en anachroniem. The student of Gaius, however,
is not very intimately concerned with this far-reaching historioal
question ; end I have been content to state my general adherence to
the traditional view without attempting to justily it by evidence.

Amonget subjecte included in this eketoh, which heve little direct
bearing on the history of Roman Law, Imay mention the descriptione
of the structure ol the different Comitia at Rome and the account of
the manner in which the powers of the Princeps were conferred.
From the point of view of the general history of the civil and

criminal law iu a State it is not of much importance to determine the ν

particular mode in which a legislative assembly is constituted, or the
precise manner in which a sovereign (whether nomina] or real) is
invested with hie authority. But these historica] questione do to
some extent underlie subjecte which are treated by Gaius ; and, as it
was not found convenient to deal with them at any great length in
the commentary, a place bad to be found tor them in this intro·

duction. ⁴
