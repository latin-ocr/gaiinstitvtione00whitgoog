must be ready and willing to give possession of the goods in exchange
for the price, and the buyer to pay the price in exchange for posses·
sion of the goede, as was the case also according to Roman law).

If the contractis not for the purchase of epeoific goods, but of
goods of a certain nature or class, only rights in personam ariae from
the agreement; for, though the eontract is complete, no property
passes until the particular goods are ascertained by delivery, or
. appropriated to the contract by the parties.

In the sale of land the equitable estate is conveyed hythe contraat
to convey, when perfected by the paymcnt of the purchase-money,
and without notice to the party in whom the legal estate is vested:
the legal estate is only passed by the subsequent daed. Formerly the
daed was a Feoffment which was inoperative without livery of seisin,
that is, delivery of possession; but now the deed of Grant posses
property without delivery of possession 'Phe assignment of an
equitabis interest in personal estate is not perfect, aa against an
assignes for valuable consideration, without notice to the trustes.

By the Code Napoloon delivery is requisita for the transfer of
property in movables, but property in immorableS, under lbench
law, is transferred as soon as the contraot is complete and the title
to it is registered.

By Roman law, the goods are at the risk of the purchaser as
soon as the contract is complete, and before the propertyis trans·
ferred. The formula, res perit domino, therefore, does not apply to
the contract of purchase and sale, as it does to other contracta, e. g.
to mutuum, commodatum, pignus.

In English law, the risk always belongs to the person in whom
the property resides, and the maxim, res perit domino, is applicable
to sales.

§13a Arra, as a general rule, was evidence of the completion
of contract, but not always, at least in the time of Justinian. If
the parties so agreed, arra was only a ponal sum, whose forfaiture
entitled either negotiator to recede from a negotiation or reaoind
a completed contract, cod. 4, 21, 17. In the absence of such
special agreement, in default of voluntary performanee, performance
could be enferced by action, and forfeiture of the arra was cumu-
lative upon and additional to such performance: the vendes, if he
was iu dafault, could not reclron the arra as part of the purchase-
money; and the vendor, if in dafault, besides dolivery of possession
and repayment of the arra, was compelled to pay an equal sumto
the vendes. (cf. Moyle, Contract of Sale in Roman law, pp. 42, 48.)
