If all the materiale belonged 10 the owner 01 the whole, then he
who acquires by usucapion the whole is owner 01 111 the materiale
11 they 111 subsequently separated, just as he would be 11 he had
acquired property in the whole by tradition or any other valid 10111
01 alienation from the original proprietor.

11 the dissoluticn 01 the whole precedes the completion 0111111·
capion, then the usucapion 01 the separate materiale has to begin ab
initio, Dig. 41, 3, 23, pr. Thus, 111 11111111 possessed a house 101
nine years and six months, he will complete 111 usucapion 01 pre·
scription in another 10111 months according to the law 01 J 11111111 :
but if any 01 the materiale (windows, doors, columns, tiles) are
separated, he will require three years to acquire them by usucapion
as movables.

11, on the contrary, 1 person begins by possessing the materiale
separately and after a time combines them into a whole, the question
whether his usucapion 01 the materiale continues to run depende on

the principles which govem the 1011 01 possession. Possessionis '

not lost by the absence 01 animus possidendi, but by 1 positive
animus non possidendi. As this cannot here be alleged to exist, tbe
usucapion 01 the materiale will continue to run in spite 01 their
combination and will be completed as soon as if they had remained
separate, Dig. 41, 3, 30, 1. An exception is produced by the pro·
bibition 01 the Twelve Tables to sue 101 building materiale as
long us they form a portion 01 1 house (tignum junctum aedibus,
Dig. 47, 3, l, pat: 101, as agere non valenti non currit praescriptio,
1110001111, the usucapion 01 the timber must be suspended
until the house 11011 any cause is demolished. Inst. 2, 1, 29.
Vangerow, § 204.

Having passed in review the nature 01 Possession and the 10111
01 the Possessor'y interdicta, we may now examine the osten mooted
question what is the relation 01 Possession to the classification 01
Rights aa Real 01 Personal: to which division 011011011, Real or
Personal, is procedure by the Possessory interdicta to be assimilated?

The answer to this must begin by distinguishing mere Possession
or Interdictpossession, from Possession associated with Titulus,
Bona fides, absence 01 furtum, that is from Usuoapionpossession.
The latter is incipient property, and is recoverable by actio in rem
Publiciana, 2 § 41 ; 1111111, it is treated in respect 01 its remedy as
1111 were perfect property in respect 01 111 persons except the owner:
Usuoapionpossession, then, though it is always liablo 10 be defeated
by the owner making good his superior claim (except in the oasa
ottho possessor having a bonitsry title), may be regarded 11 1 Real
right and is recoverable from third parties by a Real 111101.

All interdici procedure belongs to the class 01 Personal actions
