'I'he following observatione may illustrate the joint operation of
the laws concerning Trusts and the lex Falcidia under 1113 law of
J ustinian. Although the fideicommissarius or person to whom an
iuheritance or 3 portion thereos is directed to be transferred (restitui)
is charged like a coheres with 1113 legacies in proportion to the quota
which he takes, he has not like the heres 3 right of deducting
from the legaoies with which he is charged, and retaining for him·
aelf a Falcidian portion or fourth of his quota His rights against
the legatae depend on the question whether tho testator 111 directing
the transfer, or 111 other words oreating the trust, used either
expressly or by implication the terme deductis legatis, ’3113113133-
tion of legaeies: 3 clause favouring the legatees3 or whether, in
giving the legaciss, he used terms charging them on the iuheritance
(si ad heredis onus esse testator legata dixerit); which would imply
that the cestui que trust was to be exactly assimilated to the legatees.
The following examples will illustrato the working of the law.

A testator owning 400 (sestertia, or any other unite) leaves all
to A as his sole heras, bat directe him as trustee (fiduciarius)
to convcy half the iuheritance to Btfideioommissarius), and leaves
a legacp⁷ of 200 to 0. The effect is that G receives 100 113111 A and
100 from B. Dig. 36, 1, l, 20.

But suppose the testator left a legacy of 400 to 0. Thon 0 will
receive 200 from B who has no right of retaining anything, and
100 from A, who is eutitled to retain for himself one foruth of his
iuheritance, i. 3 the 1001131131113111.

Questions, however, requiring special treatment may arise in the
following cases 1-11) If an heir is charged to transfer the whole of
an iuheritance aad the legaoies are added to his charge (si ad
heredis onus esse testator legata dixerit), the interests of both the
legatae and transferres undergo, if necessary, aproportional reduction.
For instance a testator, proprietor of 400, makes A his sole heres,
but requeets him to transfer the whole suocession to B, and gives
alegaoy of 300 to (l, making use of the above-mentioned terme.
'Phe result is that A, the heres, retains 100 as his Falcidiae fourth,
and the remaining 300 arc distributed between B the cestui que
trust and G the legates, in the proportion of 4 to 3 ; thetis to say,
the cestui que trust takes ἢ or 1⁷¹3, and the legatae takes ἦ or ¹2⁸i·
Dig. 36, 1, 3pr.

(a) If the testator directe the hairto transfer the whole of the
iuheritance ‘after deduction of the legacies’ (deductis legatis), the
transferres bears the whole burden of the legaoies, and only keeps
what remeius after full payment of the legates, subject to this
