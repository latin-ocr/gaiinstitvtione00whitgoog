JURISCONSULTS OF THE REPUBLIO xxxix

ilourished about the middle of the second century a. 0. They were
lollowed by 1 long line of distinguished successore to the close oi
the Republic ¹. 'she study of law was becoming professional, but it
was not confined to a body ol men who made jurisprudence the sole
business 0111101111νωὶ 'Phe knowledge and exposition of lew was
an incident in the career 01 some oi the greatest statesmen of the
day. It may have been their ruling, but it was by no means their
sole interest; and sometimes the fruitful experience 01 1 lifetime
spent in 111 active forensic and political career was given 10 admiring
studente during the reposo which marked the 01011113 years of the
statesman’s liiei. Γ1111 rewards 01 the profession were purely
honorary; the only payment was repute, gratitudo, or political sup·
port; and the practical utility of the jurists was 11 much valued 11
their theoretical knowledge. They pleaded 01· gave advice to pleadcrs ;
they gave a scientiflo precision to the formulae ol legal business; and
they returned replies (10100110) 10 the questions ol litigante, magis·
1111111, or judices on legal points which 11011 whether beiore or in
the course 01 the hearing of 1 01111. It was through these replies,
which were given sometimes in private, sometimes in the Forum ⁵,
that the jurisconsults became great oral and literary teachers. The
replies were sometimes given in writing⁰; but, even when verbal,
were 011111 0011101111 into books3 and the audience which received
them was by no means confined to those who were primarily in·
terested in the answcrs. The young were admitted to the consulta·

tions ⁷, and the consultation often closed with 1 disputationi This
practice led eventually to systematic teaching; disciples attached
themselves to a particular exponent 01 law, who gave seme apre-
liminary training and directed others in a course 01 study that was

111011 advanced’. In no respect was this system of education re·
gulated by the State. No teacher was more authentic than another.
