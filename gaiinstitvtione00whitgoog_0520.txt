'Phe sacramentum or money solemnly staked was, it would seem,
originally deposited with the Pontifex and applied, when forseiad,
to meet the expenses oi the public sacrifices; whence its name.
(According to Varro de L. L. 5, 180, it was deposited ad Pontem ; ior
different interpretatione of this passage see Muirhead, appendix, N. F.)

According to Nettleship (op. cit. Praes), Praes was originally in all
probability an adjective, meaning ready, praes and vas being thus
distinguished: Praes is the security for a payment or performanee
ol a contraet, while Vas is the security for a person’s appearance in
court. of. Varro 6, 74, ‘Sponsor’ et ‘Praes’ et ‘Vas’ neque idern

Sohm (ξ 48, n. 2) supposes that a sacramentum was originally not

In the ceremony ss described by Gaius we may distinguish three
stages: first, an oral pleading or altercation, alluded to in the sub
sequent words ‘sicut dixi ’3 aeeondly, atrial by battle, the original
method of decidinss disputed rights3 and thirdly, the reference to
peaceful adjudication. We may suppose that cn a memorable day in
the progr-ess of civiliaation, before the combat had terminated fatally
to one oi the combatants, some one like Numa Pompilius, oi sufficient
authority to make so gresten innovation, interposed and induced the
parties to refer the disputa to arbitration. Theease would afterwards
serve as a model and precedent to future litigants3 but, frome
superstitious icat of loaing the sanction oi immemorial custom, the
earlier stages of the process would still continue to be mimicked in
solemn pantomimo. So, in English law, trial by Wager of battle,
introduced by Williarn the conqueror, was first partially superseded
by tho Grand assiae, or trial hy jury, an alternative substituted by
Henry II, and was finally abolished in the reign of George Ill.

shall issue be joined, nor trial had, by battle, in any writ oi right’
