concapit represents either et conceptum er qui concipiet. (On the
grammatical form—conceptum*see lteby 2, p. 215, n. 1.)

'Phe search with a platter and girdle was probablya custem derived
from Graece, fer a similer formality is described by Plato, Leges, 12, 7.

In the later period ef Reman law, as in modern Europe, the
seamh fer stelen goods was net conducted by the private party, but
by public efficere. In England the objectis affected by a search
warrant. Upon the informatien on esth that a party has prebable
cause te suspect that his goods have been stolen, and are concealed
in a certain dwellingheuse, and on his showing the cause of his
suspicion, ajustice of the peace may grant a warrant authorizing te
enter and search fer the said goods, and te attach the goods and the
party in whose custody thoy are found, and bring them before him,
that he may give an account how he came by them, and be dealt with
according te law. 'Phe warrant is directed te a constable er ether
public officer and net te any private persen, though it is proper that
the party complaining should be presentes assistant because he knews
his goods. As touching the party that had custody of the goede, iithey
were stelen, but net by him but by another that sold and delivered
them te him (lurtum oblatum), if it appear that he was ignorant that
they were stelen, he may be discharged as an offender and bound
ever te give evidence as a witness against him that sold them

§195. The same definitien ot theft is given by Paulus Fur est
qui delo male rem alienam contrectat, Sent. R. 2, 31, l. ‘A thiel is
he who with evil intention handles (lifts, moves, teuchos) the pre-
perty ef another.’ J ustinian gives a different delinition. Furtum
est contrectatio rei fraudulesa, lucri faciendi cause vel ipsius rei, vel
etiam usus ejus possessionisve, Inst. 4, l, 1. ‘'Pheft is the fraudulent
handling efa thing with the object ef acquiring gain either from the
thing itself or from its use, or from possession oi it.'

It may be observed that Justinian dees not sey with Paulus,
rei alienae, because a man may steal his own property, as whena
pledger steals from a pledgee er an owner trem a usufructuary. So,
by English law, te take sman's own goods out ef the hands ef a
bailee, if the taking have the effect ef charging the bailee, is larceny.
The usus ef a thing is stelen when the owner deprives the usu·
fructuary ef it, or when a pledgee unlawfully uses a pledge. Si
creditor pignere utatur, furtum committit, Inst. 4, 1, 6.

esses ef Possessio being appropriated are when a thing pledged is
taken eut ef the pledgee's possession hythe owner, er when an owner
of a thing surreptitieusly deprives the bena fide possessor ef his
possession, § 200, fer though such possessor has ne title te the thing,
his possession is recognized, till he is evicted, and he may have claims
against the owner en account ef impensae and cn ether grounds
