1v. t lle] OMNIA IVDIOIA ABSOLVTORIA 555

followed on Litis contestatio. lf this rulo had been universal no
event supervening on Litis contestatio could have extinguished the
· plaintiffs right to have judgment in his favour, which in some cases
would have been unjnst to the defendant, but the free discretion
given to the judex by the formula of a bonas fidei action enabled

him to take into account any circumstances arising after joinder of
issue which would entitle the defendant to absolution, if admissible.

In actions stricti juris it seems at first to have been held that what
would have been an adequate ground for the extinction of the plaintiti's
claim if it had happened before Litis contestatio, c. g. the purely casual
destruction of the subject of litigation, was ineffectusl to save the
defendant from condemnation if it happened after litis contestatio.
finally, however, the doctrine prevailed that, in the absence cf
liora, such an event was effectual for the absolutiones the defendant,
even when it occurred after Litis contestatio. See 3 § 180, comm.

In real actions, where the condemnationen absolution oi the
defendant was left to the arbitrium of tha judge, as in the formula
petitoria, the purely casual destruction of an object in the hands
of a bonafide possessor, even when it happened ester joinder of issue,
produced the absolution of the defendant, on the ground that im·
possibilium non est obligatio. It is to be observed, however, that
the circumstances arising subsequent to Litis contestatio effectual for
the absolution of the defendant in a real action are limited to those
which destroy the Obligation engendered by Iritis mutestatio. The
defendant, that is to say, is subject to condemnation in dameges in
spite of his having acquired the plaintiffs property by usucapion
completed after Litis contestatio (for, as we have seen, usucapicn
was not interrupted by Litis contestatio), in spite of the extinction
of the plaintiffs servitude by non-usus completed after the same date,
in spite similarly of casual destruction of the subject in his hands,
he being mala fide possessor or after mora, and in spite of destruction
by his culpa, he being bona fide possessor.

Subject to this limitation, the rule was universal: omnia judicia
esse absolutoria: i. e. all classes of action, real as well as personal,
stricti juris as well as bonae fidei, whatever the original right of the
plaintiff, mey terminate by a judgment in favour of the defendant
in consequence of some event (casual destruction of the subject,
voluntary institution hythe defendant, da) subsequent to Litis
contestatio. Of. Vangerow, t 160.

The words in the text ‘quis formulae verbis id ipsum exprimatur’
referto the direction to the judex in the formula petitoria not to
condemn the defendant if he restores the thing, which is the object
of the action, tc the plaintiff. Compare what has been stated
respecting actiones Arbitreriae, ᾗ 47, comm.
