inhia own name (suo nomine), ie. not merely as procurator or
attorney of hie father, and even in opposition to his father’s
wishes, Dig. 44, 7, 9. ‘A filiusfamilias can only, ,according to
Julian, sue in his own name for outrage, by interdict for violent
or clandestine disturbance, for a deposit, and for a thing he has
lent for use! These suits, which, in spite of the statement in
the text, were not the only, though perhaps the oldest, actions
maintainable by a person under power, deserve a brief explana·
tion. Without the right to Honour, one cf the primordial
rights of humanity, a man is scarcely a freeman, and, accordingly,
this right vesta definitively in filiusfamilias, ane does nos agel
pass out cf him te vest in his father. Any dishonouring outrage,
therefore, gave filiusfamilias a right of bringing a civil action,
called actio injuriarum, in hls own name, though the pater·
familias as a rule maintained the aetion both on his own account
and that of his eon; if, however, he was unable to do so, orbis
character was dubious, the son could proceed by himself (cf. 3 ξ 221,
and Dig. 47, 10, 17, 10, 8111), although any pecuniary damages that
he thereby recovered, being in the nature of property, were recovered
for his father. The aon under power was recognized, then, as
invented with a vindictive right, though not with a proprietary
right. The aetio injuriarum was one in bonum et aequum concepte
(compare Dig. 4⁷, 10, ll, l, and Dig. 44, 7, 34 pn), that is, the
terme of the formula (conceptio) directed the judex to assess the
damages not on any strict principle of law, but by his own
sense cf natural equiry (aequum et bonum), and this form may
have helped to melre the action maintainable by one who was
generally incompetent to sue. The interdict quod vi aut clam
was maintainable by filiusfamilias on the earne principle as the
actio injuriarum, being a means of vindicating a dishonouring
outrage inflicted on filiusfamilias by some violent disturbance of real
immovable property in defiance of hia prohibitio or summons 2ο
stay operatione and let the matter abide the result of a judicial trial.
ef. 455 138-170, comm. On the same principle a filiusfamilias
disinherited or passed over in the will of his mother cr maternal
grandfather, as such dieinheritance or pretermission was an implied
imputation of turpitude or unworthiness and therefore dishonouring,
might without the consent of his father (Dig. 5, 2, 22 pr.) vindicate
his honour by impeaching the will of inofficiositas (immorality, or
want of natural affection), although such querela inofficiosi testa·
menti, being an action having a right to property for its object, would
not otherwise have been maintainable by a filiusfamilias. If the
plaintiff filiusfamilias could show that the disinheritanee or omission
was not due to hie own demerita he invalidated the will by. a
