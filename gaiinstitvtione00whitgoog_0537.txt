protecting persone whose rights had previously not been recognized,
or mitigating the rigoure and liberalining the narrow·mindedness of
the ancient barbarous legislation: granting to the bonitary owner by
inheritance or purchaeethe protection enjoyed by the quintary owner ;
giving to the alien the redreee provided for the citizen, and preserving
to the creditor the remedies extinguiehed by the debtor'e diminution
of statue. In their teek of ameliorating the law the praetore proceeded
ae unobtrueively as possible, by tacit rethor than by open legislation,
and rather by innovatione in the adjective code, to use Bentham'e
expression, or code oi procedure, than in the substantive code. The
introduction of the formulary system, giving them authority tc
create new actione, had virtually invested them with much legislative
power. The new actione introduced by the praetor were called
actiones utiles. Utiles actiones were either ficticiae or in factum,
or constituted by a change of parties in the intentio and condem·

cf. 3 § 219, comm. Let ue examine these three different forms
of praetorian action in respectos the mode oi their operation. The
praetor procecded in two ways, (ι) with cr (a) without the use of
fiction.

(1) When he manisd a fictitioue action, that is, one whose
formula was iramed in exactly the same way ae that of a civil
action, except that a fictio wae added to it, the fiction furnished
an exact measure of the extent to which the old law had been
abandoned. The praetor might in thie way suppreee some clement
of the title to which the remedy at civil law was annexed3 and
make the same consequences follow as if thie clement had existed.
The fiction would bc the false assumption that the plaintifi'e case
satisfied the abrogated condition. By ruling that the fictitioue
proposition should not be called in question, and that the defendant

should not be allowed to demur to the plaintifi'e claim on the ground ·

that the conditione required for maintaining it were unsatisfied‚ the
praetor would virtually abrogata the old law, and substitute for it
, a new one. In the cases given by Gaius the conditione which are
assumed relate to inheritance,usucapion‚ citizenship,capitie deminutio.
'I'hey might conceivably relate to any other institution of civil law.
In the Actio Pauliana protecting creditore against fraudulent aliena·
tione, the fiction was an assumption of non-delivery—-the formula
being something like this: si quem hominem L. Titius in hoc anno
fraudationis causa Numerio Negidio, qui eam fraudem non ignoravit,
mancipio dedit, L. Titius Numerio Negidio mancipio non dedisset,
tum ei pareret eum hominem de quo agitur ex jure Quiritium
