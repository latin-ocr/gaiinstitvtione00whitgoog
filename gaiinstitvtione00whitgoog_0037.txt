INTERPRETATION BY THE MAGISTRATE xxxi

Furia on testaments, the Lex Voconia on inheritances; and it is abo
true that certain important changes in civil procedure were sanctioned
by the people, the most far-reaching of these changes being perhaps
'that effected by the Lex Aebutia, which helped tc replace the Legis
Actio by the Permula ¹. But the legislation referring to private law
and civil procedure at Rome is in no way compar-able in bulk to
that which dealt with criminal and constitutions] law. Even those
Leges or Plebiscita that dealt with civil procedure, perhaps did little
more than ratify a change that had been already accomplished in the
cour-ts, cr carry this change a few steps further. And, as to the
alterations in the material elementa of private law, these alterations
were determined tc a far greater extent by interpretation than by
legislation.

Interpretation at Rome assumed two forms. It was either the
work of the magistrate or the work of the jurisconsult. The
magistrate chiefly concerned with the interpretation of private law
was the Praetor. The office of Praetor is said tc have originated
as a result cf the Licinian laws of 367 rac.² This new magistrate
was created for the purpose of performing most of the judicial
business of the Consule, who, on account of the increasing complexity
cf politica] life, were found incapable of conducting the whole of the
home and foreign affairs of Rome. For more than 120 years this
single magistrate administered civil justice tc citizens and aliens.
At the close of this period (242 nc.) a second Praetor was appointed⁸
whose duty it was to decide cases between aliens (Peregrini) and
between citizens and aliens. The former (Praetor qui inter cives jus
dicit] was lrnown by the colloquial name oi Praetor Urbanus 3 the
latter (Praetor qui inter peregrinos jus dicit) was known by the
similarly abbreviated title of Praetor Peregrinus.

Erery magistrate at Rome was in the habit of notifying to the
public the manner in which he meant to exercise his authority, or
any change which he comtemplated in existing regulations, by means
cf a public notice (Edictum). In the case of magistrates who were
merely concemed with administrativa work, such notices were often
occasional (edicta repentina); in the case of magistrates concerned
with judicial business, they were oi necessity valid for the whole
period during which the magistrates held their office, and capable of
