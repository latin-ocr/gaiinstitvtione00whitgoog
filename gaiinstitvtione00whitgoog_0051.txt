LEGISLATION DURING THE PRINCIPATE xlv

by law on (iaessr and Angustus, had been exercised by Claudius and
Vespasian as censore, and finally became a right inherent in the
Principate itself. (4) The Princeps, besides being a member of all
the great religione collegas, was, as Pontifex Maximus, the official
head of the state-religion, and was invested by law with the power of
r executing ordinancee which were to the interest of the religione life
citha community¹. (ὅ) supplementary powers, which cannot be
described by a common name or connected with any definite office,
¹ were granted to the Princeps. Some of these were meane by which
hia control over the magistrates and the Senate was increased. Such
ἶ were the rights oi securing the election of certain candidates for
η cfficeby means ofa recommendation (Commendatio), and ofexercising
powers in relation to the Senate superior tc those possessed by the
other magistrates.

An authority thus endowed could not fail to exerciss a strong
directiug influence on the sources of law and the methods of
procedure. The influence asserted itself from the first3 yet for at
least two centuries there was always a formal, and sometimes a real
recognition of the theory on which the Principate was based—the
theory of a dual control exercised by the Princeps on the one hand,
hythe usual organa of the Republic cn the other. The chief orgarr
by which the Republic was represented was now no longer the
People, hut the Senote3 and the dual sorereignty-or ‘Dyarchy‚’
osithae been called—can be illustrated chiefly by the division of
authority between the Princeps and the Senate.

As regards the sources of law, even the utterances of the People
were for some time elicited. Leges and Plebiscita-speoimens of
which are to be found in the Leges Juliae of Augustus, the Lex
Aelia Sentio belonging to the reign of the same monarch, the Lex
Junia Norbana of the reign of Tiberius, the Leges Claudiae of the
Emperor Claudius—continued to be passed during the early
Principate. 'I'he last trace oi legislation belongs to the reign of
Narra [96-98 an.) ³.

hren before legislative power had been surrendered by the Comitia,
it had begun to pass to the Senate3 and down to the third century
ara, such general ordinancee as tended to alter the fundamental
legal relations of Reman citizens to one another were generally
expressed in the form of Senatusconsulta The Senatusccnsultum

utterances are often couched in an advisory form ³, ae though the
