At a 10101 period, when execution in a suit might consist in the
compulsory delivery 01 the specifio thing, alienation by 0 defendant
was recognized as an injury 10 the plaintiff. Accordingly Justinian's
code, 8, 36, 2, not only avoided every alienaticn by a 0101111111 01 1110

§ 120. J ustinian, Inst. 4, 13, 8, uses the term temporalis 00 equiva-

exceptio sometimes denotes the ples 01 prescription (longi temporis

perpetua, 01 peremptoris, i. e. not 0 temporary or dilatory one.
