Litis Contestatio, § 50 (cf. Lenel, p. 225), supposes that the following
may have been its simplest form : Maevius judex esto. Quod ultius
Seio filiofamilias mensam argenteam commodavit, qua de re agitur,

quidquid ob eam rem Seium Titio dare facere oportet ex fide bona, ejus
judex Gaium patrem, dumtaxat De peculio aut Quod in rem Gaii patris
versum est, condemnato. In Quod jussu, Exercitoria, and Institoria.

the Adjeetio was apparently a part of the demonstratio, something 1

corresponding to a demonstratio being required even where the Ἴ

aetion was ene de certa pecunia or de certa re. Keller suggests 3
the following formula: Quod jussu Gaii patrie Seius filiusfamilias '
a Titio hominem emit, quidquid ob eam rem Selom ultio dare faeere
oportet ex fide bona, id Gaium patrem condemna. In all of them
· the agent alone was mentioned in the intentio, ξ 34 comm, the
condemnation being directed against the person of the principal. cf.
Lenel, ξ 206. We have not sufficientdata for determining the nature ot
the formula in Tributoria. 'Phe knowledge of the father, the inadequate
distribution, the limitatien of liability to the merx peculiaris, would
seem to require an Adjeotio tu all three parts of the formula.

By the combination in one formula of the actions De peculio and
De in rem uerso, the superior could be successively sued on two
grounds If the actions had been distinet, then, as their intentio
must haye been identical, Litis Consumptio would have hindered
their successive institution. ἵ

The agent and prinoipal were correal debtors, at least when the

agent was a free person, 3 § 110 comm, and against whichever an
action was brought, the intentio averred the debt of the agent, so that
on Litis contestatio against either, the other was discharged by Res
in judicium deducta. 'ro namedy the injustius in such cases Jush'nian η
enacted that bringing an action against one correal debtor did not ⁸
consume the right of action against the other. cod. 8, 40, 28.
' The actio de in rem verso, given against the paterfamilias or
dominus, if a transaction entered into by a person in their power,
though they had not authorized it, turned to their profit (si in rem
ejus versum est), is based on the principle of the condictio, as ag. of
the condictio indebiti, that where the property of one person is
increased without any adequate legal ground (sine causa) attha
expense of another, the latter can claim restitution. The actions de
peculio and tributoria, which had the peculium or the merx peculiaris
ol the son or slave for their object, show that while the peculium
of the subordinate members of the family was legally the property of
the head, it was recognized by the law for some purpoees as itit
were the de facto property of the son or slave.

Thus obligations between them and their superior, which were
unenforceable by aetion (obligationes naturales), had to be taken into
