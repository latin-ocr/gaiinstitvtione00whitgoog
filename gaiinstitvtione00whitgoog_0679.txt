According to this theory then possession is to be regarded as
conferring s right against the person interiering with it ancillary
to that of ownership. cf. Ihering‚ Ueber den Grund des Besitzes·
schutzes; Sobm, § 67.

The classical jurists seem not to hare considered the question. The
delict adjudicatsd upon in intardict procedure is in form the violation
of a public duty, the duty of obedience to the magistrate. That it was
in substance the violation of a private or civil right of a person who
bas been dispossessed did not appear on the face of the proceedings;
and consequently ths nature oi this right had not to be investigated.

Possession, which involves a right against the world to ireedom
from molestation till a better right is shown, came to be regarded
by the Roman jurists end in subsequent legal history as de facto
ownership standing alongside and in close relationship to legal owner·
ship. So the contrast between the possessory interdicte and vindi·
catio reminds Englishmen of the old division of actions in English
law into Possessory aud Droitural, which our mediaeval lawyers
adopted from the civil and Canon Law. According to this view the
Interdicts Uti Possidetis and Utruhi were, at least at the time when
Gaius wrote, not delictal‚ except in form, hut possessory in character,
the infringement ol the rights they protected wanting the ordinary
requisites of a delict. But·¹ though the possessory interdicta seem to
have for their object simply the protectior of possession, as the object
of vindicatio is simply the protectior] of ownership, they are actions
in personam not in rem, that is they only lie against the party who im·
mediatsly interseras with the possession of another, not against third
parties

The primery right on which they are founded cannot be better
stated than in the words-⁶ possessor hoo ipso, quod possessor est, plus
juris habet, quam ille, quinon possidet’ The law assumes that the .
possessor is owner till the contrary is proved in an appropriate action.
cf. Bruns, Die Besitzlrlagen des romischen und heutigen Rechts.

That in a given system of positive lew what is in substance an
action for the protection of property may assume the form of an
action on Delict, we may convince ourselves by remembering some
of the anomalies oi the scheme of actions in English lew. Trover
and Detinus, which were brought to recover movabls property, were
kinds of Trespass, that is of action on delict: Assumpsit, the remedy
for enlorcing a simple contract, was extornelly a species of Trespass
on the Osse, another action on delict: and Ejectment, practioally the
sole roal action for the recovery of land, was theoretically another
species oi Trespass -

The Interdict, as originating action, bears some resemblance to
a now abolished institution of English law, the Original writ But
