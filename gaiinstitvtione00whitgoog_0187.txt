the right. 'l'he secondary object of a right, however, is not always
abody; it may be corporeal or incorporeal. For instance, dominium
over land is a right to forbearance on the part of all the world from
molestation of the owner in dealing with the land. haervinus,
says right of way, is a right te forbearance on the part of all the
world from molestation of the person entitled when he pasees over
certain land. A contractual right is a right to a positiveact orforbear·
anos on the part of a determinate person, say, to the conveyance or
delivery of a certain piace of land. In these cases, land, the secondary
object of the right, is something corporeal. So, too, when a
parson is the object of a right; for instance, aohild or a gladiator,
3 § 199, in the possession (demntion or custodyj of the parent or
employer, and whose removal from such possession engenders in the
removing party an obligation er delicto. But in primordial rights,
the object, at least as distinguished from the two parties in whom
the right and duty respectively vest, is something incorporeal.
A man has a right to forbearance on the part of all the world from
molestation in his life, healdr, locomotion, honour. These objecta
of the right are incorporeal. Other rights, apparently, have no
determinate object, corporeal or incorporeal, to which they are

1 correlated. In a right to the services of a menial or gladiator,

for instance, it would be hard to indicata any secandary or corporeal
object to which the obligation of the menial or gladiator relatas.
Itis clear that no division of Objects of right will coincide with

aclassitication of Rights: while, if we divide Res in the meta· -

physica] sense of the World, or Being, or -Existence (a sense sug·
gaated by the differentiae, corporalia, and incorporalis), Dominium,
like all other rights, will be a member of the branch res incorporales,
or Ownership. (lmus, however, wishes us to identify Dominium
with res corporalia, and to make Obligation and the fractione of
Dominium (servitutes), and even some forms of Dominium (e. g.
hereditas), members of the contra-distinguished branch, res incor-
poralis (Cf. 35 83, omnes ejus-res incorporales et corporales quaeque
ei debita sunt)

Gaius was probably not entirely responsible for this conhrsion of
thought, which, perhaps, was too deeply inwoven in the formulae
of Roman jurisprudence to be easily eliminated by an institutional
writer. E. g. the declaration (intentio) of a real action (in rem
actio) was of the form: si paret (ι) illum fundum—(a) illam
hereditatem-actoris esse. (Of. 4 ξ 3 ln rem sotio est oum aut
corporalem rem intendimus nostram esse aut jus aliquod nobis
competere) Now as hereditas is a jus successionis, j 14, it is clear
that, if the second formula is correct, the first formula ought to be,
not, Si paret illum fundum-but, Si paret illius fundi dominium-
