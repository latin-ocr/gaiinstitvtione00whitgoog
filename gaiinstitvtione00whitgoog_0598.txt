Although the division into judicia legitima and judicia quae imperio
continentur does not exactly coincide with the division into actiones
legitimae and actiones honorariae (e. g. an actio in factum, if
litigatsd at Rome before a Roman judex by two Romans, would
be judicium legitimum, and, vice versa, an actio civilis, if litigated
before recuperators or in the provinces or between 011000, would be
judicium quod imperio continetur, 1 109), yet it is essentially the
same, being based 00 the same antithesis 01 the Legislator and the
Executive.

§i 104, 100. Statutory 0011000 (judicia legitime), 00 named perhaps
from the lex J ulisjudician'a, the statute by which they wenc defined.
had by that statute a pendency of eighteen months After that
period they could neither bs prosecuted nor nenewed‚ 00 the right
01001100 was consumed by res in judicium deducta. 11 the delay
was caused by the defendant the plaintiff had a remedy by an
action De dolo, Dig. 4, 3, 18, 4. Actione binding (continentia) by
magisterial power had 0 01111 01000100 pendency, the commission of
the judex only continuing in 10000 so longas the praetor who
appointed him, and who himself was only appointed for a year,
continued in office.

tion 01 10301 process with what we read 01 the duration of some
controversies. 11001101 speaks of a cause that had been litigated in
the three Fora, the Forum Romanum, the Forum iulium, and the
Forum Augustum, for twenty years:

Lis 10 bis decimae numerantem frigora brumae

This limit to the duration 0110301 proceedings, though it has
left some traces in the Digest, was obsoleto long before Justinian·
