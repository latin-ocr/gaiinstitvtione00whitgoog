§5 26-29. Distress in English law bears a certain resemblance to
Execnticn. Each isthe application of constraint 80 a detendant’s will
by 00111110 of his goods. But making a distressie a legalized act ol
sels-redress bya private person, as of a landlord for securing his rent,
and may take the place of or precede an action: execution follows
atter judgment obtained in an action, and is the act of the executive
at the command of the sovereign. The pignoris capio ol the older
Romen law corresponded to distress3 the pignoris cepio of the
formulary system generally was a mods of execution.

Perhaps pignoris capio, lilre manus injectio, was itself simply anast
01 regulated Selt-redress, when there was no other legal remedy
available, and did not amount to legis actio unless it led to a suit
in which 8110 legality ot the distraint was brought into question.

Pignoris capio in the older system of procedure was a remedy
allowed in cases of a public character, that is, in claime relating to
military service, to religion, 01 80 the revenue. In the first case, ξ 27,
8110 remedy was established hy 01108011, that is, was anterior to the
Twelve Tables; in the second case, § 28, 18 was given by 8110 Twelve
Tables ; in the third case, t 28, it was created by law subseqnent 80
the Twelve Tables,

The institution appears to have been transplanted from Grecos.
Cicero mentions it as in force at Corinth, De Republica, 2, 20, 36.
‘Tarquinius Priscus instituted the present organisation of the

cavalry. At Corinth, whence he came, there was a practice of allot ¹

ting horses st the public expense and taxing the childless and widows
lor their maintenanoe.' The private persons thus appointed mili·
tary paymasters appear to have been called tribuni aerarii, Gellius 7,
10. In later times soldiers were paid hythe Quaestors trom the

*public treasury.
