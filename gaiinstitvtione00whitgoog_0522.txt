462 DE ACTIONIBVS [iv. §t 10-20.

land ilseli, which was vindicated, in the presence of the magistrate
(injure manum conserere), but later a practice grew up, which is
referred to by Cicero, for the parties, by order oi the magistrate, going
by themselves attended by witnesses to the place, and after duly
observingtheceremonialreturningtotheOourt finally this wesdis·
continued, and ss we see hythe text, ξ 17, a part of the thing vves

, brought in the first place before the magistrate to represent the whole.

After the vindication and coartet-vindication had taken place, the
praetor had to assign interim possession of the vindiciae or object
which was claimed, to one of the parties, and to take security from him
thet he would be ready to produce this object oi litigetion (called
here lis, cf. Cic. Mur. 12, 27) end the mesneprofits‚ which are denoted
by the term vindiciae (praedes litis et vindiciarum). Gaius gives no
indication of the principle cn which the praetor acted in making
this assignarent, simply saying secundum alterum eorum vindicias
dicebat In later process the possessor, who was the defendant in the
action, would be allowed to remain in possession, on giving security
that he would satisiy the judgment, and it would be for the vindicent
to prove his title. The difference here isthat the two parties stand on
an cqual footing, each of them in turn vindicating the thing, and so
neither of them being in the position of defendant. It seems resson·
able, however, to suppose that the praetor would be governed by the
same motives in making his swerd as intluenoed him in grenting
the possessory interdicte, so that the party secking to evict the other
would not asa rule obtain possession till he had proved his title.

The Oon'dictio wee unknown to the Twelve Tables, having been
created by the lex Silis of a somewhat later but uncertain date, and
extended by the lex (telpurnis, the date of which is also uncertain.
We sec by the text, ξ 20, that the reason for instituting another ectio
in personam, when the sctio sacramenti and per judicis postulationem
were already ovailable‚ was not clear to the jurists at the time when
Gaius wrote. But tho object oi the Lex Silia in instituting the con-
dictio may have been to supply a more prompt and efficient remedy for
the recovery of money dsbts than previously existed, arelorm in pn>
cedure which would be required when summary execution on account
of nexum was cbolished. By this new form of action a creditor could
forthwith give notice to his debtor, called condictio, from which the
proceeding derives its name, to appear belom the magistrate in thirty
days to have a judex appointed. If, aethere is some reason for
thinking, the serving of this notice was an extra-judicial act, it would
bo easily executed by the party interested And should the dobt
not have been satisfied within the thirty days, the creditor was
entitled to a judicium, depending on a simple snd clearly defined
issue. Thus the proceedings in jure would bo much curtailed.
