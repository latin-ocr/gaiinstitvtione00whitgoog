actions are given ae exemplos), and such other actions, whether civil
er praeterian (e. g. depositi, commodati, locati, tutelae, rei uxoriae,
deli, metus, interdictum de vi, §§ 162, 163), es were brought te ebtain
restitutien er production. The formula arbitraria could net be used
in an aetio empti, fer the object 11 thie aetion was not ef the nature
ef a restitutien: nor could the formula arbitraria be employed in
actions stricti juris er actions founded 1111111111, since a pecuniary'
cendemnation was in these actions also sufficient remedy.

01 the formula arbitraria in a real aetion with 1 termule petitoria,
§§ 91, 92, we hare an instance in Cicero: Lucius Octavius judex
esto: Si paret fundum Capenatem, que de agitur, ex jure Quiritium
[P. Servili] esee, neque is fundus [1). Catule] (cf. Roby‚ 2, 443, 1. 1)
restituetur, In Verrem, 2, 12 ς cf. 1, 45. In an action 111 the
preductien as a preliminary to the restitution 11 a parson or thing
(ad exhibendum) the clause would be 11 the ferm ‘nisi exhibeat,' ‘si
arbitratu tue Aule Agerie nen exhibebitur'and generally seme special
medificatien 11 nisi aeteri satisfaciat. (As te the attempts which
have been made te reconstruct thie formula see Lenel, tit xv. § 90.)
11 noxal actions, 5 75, which are analegons in procedure te actiones
arbitrariae, there was probably no clause ‘nisi nexae dedat,’ but the
y'udgment was 11 the ferm Publium Maevium Lucio Titio decem
aureis condemno aut nexam dedere, Inst. 4, 17, 1; the defendant
being intended to exercise the eleetien 11 paying damagss er surren-
dering 1111 author 11 the misehief.

es seon as therule was established : omnia judicia esse absolutoria,
5 114, that in every action a defendant might avoid condemnatien
by satistying the plaintiff's claim even after litis contestatio, it might
seem at first sight that the dormale arbitraria was rendered
unneecssary. But this was net se; for in actiones which were net
arbitrariae ne alternative was allowed te the judex in the een·
demnatie, and the damagee were net meant asa penal sum te enferee
obedience 11 the judge’s order. Whereas inan actio arbitraria as
seen as the arbitratus er order was prenouneed, the defendant would
know that he would inevitably be condemned unless he made the
restitutio er exhibitio required.

The intentio ef au action with a formula in iactum concepta was
sometimes one-limbed: e g. Si peret. . . vocatum esse, ξ 46, and
sometimes twelimbed: e. g. si paret (r) Aulum Agerium rem de·
posuisse (a) eamque delo male Numerii Negidii Aulo Agerie reddi·
tam nen esse, 1 47. Α ene-limbed intentio would be used when the
defenee was a simple traverso er contradiction 11 tho 1111 alleged
by the plaintiff: atwolimbed formula would be used when the
defendant confessed the 1111 alleged hythe plaintiff, but alleged

eme: 1111
