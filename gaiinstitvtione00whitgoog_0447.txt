Three other obligations quasi er contractu, those that are en·
forced by an action ior division of common property between tenente
in common (communi dividundo), by action for partition of an in·
heritance between coheredes (familiae erciscundae), by an action for
demarcation of boundaries between adjoining landowners (finium
regundorum), resemble the obligations arising in pertnership. These
actions are distinguished from all others by the adjudicatio, a clause
in the formula which empowered the judex by the mere effect of his
judgmeut to operate a transfer of property, 4 5 42. They are called
mixed actions by Ulpian, because both parties are equally plaintiff
and defendant, Dig. 44, 7, 37,1 ; by J ustinian (Inst. 4, 6, 20), because
they are both real and personat that is, are founded on obligatior,
but are concerned also with questions between the parties concerning
ownersbip or inheritance, which they have to decide, Keller, civil
Process, t 873 they were, however, regarded by the jurists as pro·
perly personal actions, as arising from a quasi-contractus] relation

The obligation of α heres toa legates, enforceable by actio legati
in personam or condictio ex testamento, is another case of obligatio
quasi ex contractu. The aditio cf the hereditas may bc regarded aa
an undertaking to satisfy the bequests, if there are assets for the
purpose. Aditio is called Obligatio, 2 §5 35, 36.

Again, money paid by mistake or without consideration (indebi-
tum solutum) created an obligation to repey, enforceable by indebiti
soluti condictio, which closely resembles the obligation created by
the contract of mutuum, see § 91.
