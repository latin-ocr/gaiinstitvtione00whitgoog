heritance shall either be transferred in totality to the transferres,

in the proportion of their interests. See Inst. 2, 23, 7.

’ The following observatione may serve to complete the explanation

, of the Sc. Trebellianum and the Sc. Pegasianum.

Succession is the transfer of a right from one person (auctor) to
another person (successor), such as occurs, for instance, in the con·

¹ veyance or alienation ol property. Here the same right of ownership

that was previously vested in the alienoris subsequently vested in
the alienes. The right continues the ssme; the person invested

ἶ therewith is changed. It was characteristic of obligatio; arelation

between two determinate persons (before, at least, the comparatively
modern invention of papers payable to the holder and transferable by

, delivery) that it was not capable of a similar alienation. All that
ᾖ could be donato accomplish a similar result was to employ one of
f two processes, Novation or (lession of Action, ξ 38. ³ tt 155-162,
¹ comm. Iu these procedures there isstrictly speaking no Succeseion,
l for in Novation the transferree is not invested with the same right
ξ that previously vested in the transforma but a new right iscroated

in the transferroe while the old right of the transferreris extin-

’ guished: and in Procuration or (lession the right still continues

nominally in the transferror, as representative of whom the trans·
ferree recovers it or enforces it by action, retaining for himself what
isrecovered.

This inalienability of obligations, however, was confined to

i amoveas successione (in singularum rerum dominium successio]:

mmm succession (per universitatem successio) or the trans-
mission of the ideal whole of a patrimony, of which we have
an example in hereditas testamentary or intestato, differed from
sanemus succession by the capacity of passing obligation as well
aa Dominion. The heres oi the testator or intestata sued and was
saed in his own name on the obligations, active or passive, that
originally vested in the deceased. But umvaasan succession was an
institution only recognized by Roman jurisprudence in certain
definite cases. It was a formidable operation aud rigorously cir·
cumscribed. It was not a transaction that the law allowed to be
acoomplished at the discretiori of individua] parties in pursuance of
private convention. It was only admitted in the cases enumerated
by Gaius, ᾗ 98, and, without legislative interference, the list could
not beaugmented.

These difficulties in the transfer of obligation opposed a great
obstacle to the transfer (restitutio) of trust successione: and these
difficulties were partielly removed by the Se. Trebellianum, and
more completely by J ustinian, by investing the Restitutio with the
