’1.11197-200] ΙΝ INTEGRVM RESTITVTIO 117

undeing oi a wrong, any replaoement 01 1 person or his right in
his or its original condition, whether by the voluntary 1101011110
wrongdoer, 01 11101 action brought, and then either at the invitation
011110 judge (in virtue 01 the clause, ni restituat, 1147101111
execution 011 judicisl sentence. But in the phrase we are exam·
ining it denotas the act, not 01 aprivate party, but 01 1 magisterial
authority. In integrum restitutio is the restitution by the praeter
of a person to his original legal condition, in cases when some injury
has been donc to him by operation 01 law. The interposition in such
cases 01 the highest Roman minister of justice bears some analogy
to the use made of the prerogative 01 the Orown incur own early legal
history. The iunction of thus overruling the law where it collided
with equity was only confided to the highest magisterial authority,
and even in his hands was governed by the principle that he was only
supposed to act in a ministerial, notin a legislative capacity. Five
grounds or titles (justae causae) to extraordinary relief (extraordi-
narium auxilium) were recognimd and enumerated in the edict,
Dig. 4, 1: intimidetion (metus), fraud (dolus malus), absence, enur,
minority (aetatis infirmitas). Two, however, 01 these titles, fraud
and intimidation, had additional remedies in the ordinary course
01 procedure (ordo jndiciorum), where they were recognized ss
grounds of exception and personal action. 'lhus we find that a
praetor called Octavius introduced the actio and exceptio metus
mentioned by Cicero, Verr. 2, 3, 65, where the actio metus is called
formula Octaviano, and that the famous Aquilius Gallus, the
colleague 01 cicero, introduced, the exceptio and the actio (1011, Cic.
de 1111111 Deorum, 3, 30.

1110 chronological order 01 the remedy by Action and the remedy
by Restitution, like that 011110 historieal relation 01 interdict to
action, is disputed. Savigny, §§ 112, 191, 199, holda that the remedy
by Restitution was older than the remedy byAction3 while Vangerow,
1 185, holds that the remedy by Action was older than the remedy
by Restitution. As remedies they were very different in character,
the effect 011 grant 01 restitution being simply to reinstate a person
111 legal right, which he had lost, not to give him damages on
10101111 01 the violation 01 1 right

There are three conditione 01 Restitution: (1) The first condition
is a Laesim by the operation 01 law, i. e. a disadvantageous change
in civil righm 01 obligations brought about by some omission
or disposition of the person who olsims relisi. This disadvantage
may either consist in positive loss 01 required property, 01 iu missing
again which would not have involved, 011 the part of another,
apositive loss of acquired property. An instance oi such 1 lession

would be the loss 01 property by omitting to interrupt 1 usucapio
