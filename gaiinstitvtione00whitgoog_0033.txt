THE LEGISLATIV E ASSEMBLIES xxvii

¹ votes; or, if we add the other centurias of knights (18), of corporate

bodies such as the Fabri (4), and of Proletarii (1), we find that the
first class and the knights commanded but eighty-eight votes out of
atotal of 373 ¹. This system, which lessened the influenoe of the
wealthier classes, was temporarily abolished by Sulla in 88 n. c.²;
but it was soon restored, and there is every reason to suppose that it
survived the Republic and formed the basis of the arrangement of the
Comitia Centuriata under the Principate³. Although the Comitia
was organized on this triba] basis for the distribution of votiug power,
the voting unit was still the century and not the tribe. The seventy
centuries oi each class voted in turn ; the decision ot each century
was determined by the majority of the votes of its individual
members; and the majority of the centuriae determined the decision
oi the assembly.

'l'he Comitia Centuriate, although of the utmost importunae in the
structure of the Roman constitution as the body that elected the
magistrates with imperium and the censore, that exercised capital
jurisdiction and declared war, oeased to be employed in the period of
the developed Republic as an ordinary legislative assembly. It was
difficolt to summan and unwieldy in its structure, and its position
aaa legislative body cameto be usurped by the two assemblies of the
tribes. Yet, aa we shall see ⁴, it may have been held that legislative
sets, which affected the fundamental principles of the constitution,
should be submitted tc the centuriea

The Comitia Tributa Populi had probably been instituted in
imitation of the Plcbeiau Assembly of the Tribes. It was found
convenient that the Populus should meet in this way es well as the
Plebs; and the Tribus-the voting unit which had already been
employed for assemblies of the Plebs—was used for assemblies of
the whole people. The Tribus was always a division of the territory
oi the Roman State in Italy, and the tribes grew in number as this
territory increased until by the year 241 rao. they had reached their
final total oi thirty-five. Itis generally believed that originally only
holders of land were registered ae members of a tribe⁵ ; but there is

that the description given by Cicero (de Rep. ir. 22. 89, 40) refers, not to the older
arrangement, but to the reformed Comitia. Mommsen allows the 70 votes ior
