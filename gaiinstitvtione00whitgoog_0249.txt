testator, who would have been selfsuooessor if he had not been

mitted deseendant (bonorum possessio eontra tabulas). Contra-tabulas·
possession did not make a will absolutely void as the passing over
01 suus heres might do: 11 the praeteritus was an emancipated son,
although he obtained eontra-tabular possession, he was bound, as we

oession was partly intestato, partly testate.
