Cicero ad Familiares, 13, 27. ‘Howeven I will sparo no trouble,
and as you lawyers do in your books of formulae, I will present yon

the toachers 01 011 school, and then, as the headings 01 the formulae
say, handled the same subject in a different form!

One grean advantage 01 the actiones in factum was that they were

01 enabling filii familiarum tosus that formulae in factum were given
in some actions as well as formulae injus. cf. 1 § 55, comm.

We shall sse hereatter that actio in sactum differed from actio 11
jus in respect 01 (1) Plus petitio and in respect 01 (2) Neratio.

tentio specitying a particular state 01110111 thebaeis 01 the plaintiffs
claim, 01, 1 60, would be capable 01 plus petitio: while an actio with
atormula injus concepta would only be capable 01 plus petitio where
the intentio was certa eg. condictio cartae pecuniae or certae rei, not
where the intentio was incerta, Quidquid paret, &c

(a) Novatio necessaria was only produced by Litis contestatio when
the formula was injus concepta, the right 01 the plaintiff not bdng

'Phe words Nisi restituat (cf. formula of actio depositi, ξ 471
exhibeat, are the clause 01101001111111111101111111111111111. ln the
formulary system the condemnation was always pecuniary, 1 48 ; the
defendant was always condemned by the judgment to pay the plaintili
asum 01 money. By means, however, 01 the alternative clause, nisi
restituat, 110, in a termula arbitraria the plaintiff could put pressum
on the defendant to make him restore or produce to the plaintiffa
specific thing which would be a remedy something like that 01
specific performance in English Law. Thus by this clausethe judex,
having pronounced against the defendant, made 1 preliminary order
(jesana, arbitrium) 101 the restitution or productiori 01 the thing ; and
if it was obeyed the defendant was absolved‚ but 11 11 was disobeyed
the plaintiff was allowed to assess his own damages on cath, whereby
the defendant might in 1101 suffer a penalty for disobedience to the
order. In later times, indeed, it seems 10 have become the practice

Actiones arbitrariae included real actions, named as formulae
