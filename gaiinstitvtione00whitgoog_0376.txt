316 DE OBLIGATIONIBVS [111. §t88, 89.

The law of contraot differs from other branchos of law in that its
function is rather auxiliary to human freedom than restrictius or
coeroive. While the law of Status and the law of Ownership are
imperious and peremptory and felt by the letters they impose on
human volition, the law of Contractis ministeria] to manifestatione
of will, and foetere and protecte the most diversified activity and
entsrprisa The law of contraot is the most plastic part of the code
and the part most susoeptible of adaptation to the necessities of
commarca: it is the portion of Roman jurisprudenoe which has
survived with least alteration in modern Europ03 andos all depart·
ments of modern codes it is tho portion whose relative importauoe is
already the greatest and is continually increasing.

But though to contraot isa matter of free choioe, obligatior, to bo
a subject of jurisprudonce‚ implica compulsion: Debitor intelligitur
isaquo invito pecunia exigi potest, Dig. 50, 16, 108. ‘Debtor
denotas a person from whom money may be extorted against his
will :' i.e. it excludes merely moral dutioe (officia) booauoe the state
applies no coercion to enforoe their performance.

Obligation, in the narrower sense in which we prooeed to use the
term, also excludes those duties which the legislator imposes on
all the world alike towards a person invested with a Real right,
whether a Primordial right, a right of Status, or a right of
Dominion. Duties correlative to jus in rem, which aro invariably
negative in character, have scarcely received a distinctiva appella·
tion in the Latin language: for the sake of distinction from moral
duties they may be called Necessitas, and ior the sake ol distinction
from Positive duties, Necessitas abstinendi.

Justinian defines Obligation as follows: Obligatio est juris vin·
culum quo necessitate astringimur alicujus solvendae rei secundum
nostrae civitatis jura, Inst. 3, 13. ‘Obligation is a legal hond, by
which we are compelled to some performanoe (solutio) in aocordanoe
with the law of the state'

'Phe performanoe (solutio) which it is the object of tho law to enforoe
when it imposes an obligation is sometimes decomposed into three
elementa, expressed by three terme, dare, lacere, praestare. 111
personam actio est quotiens oum aliquo agimus qui nobis ex con·
tractu vel ex delicto obligatus est, id est, oum intendimus dare,
facere, praestare oportere, 4 ξ 2. ‘A personal action pursues an
obligation arising irem contraot or delict, and declares that the
defendant is bound to oonvey, perlorm, or make some render lor
awrongss obligationum substantia non in eo consistit ut aliquod
corpus nostrum aut servitutem nostram faciat, sed ut elium nobis
obstringat ad dandum aliquid vel faciendum vel praestandum, Dig. ·
