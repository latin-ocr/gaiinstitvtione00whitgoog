580 DE ACTIONIBVS [11. §urie-13⁷.

Digest. A person who has appointed two general agents 31 all his
property does not give authority to one of them to sue the other,
unless he does so 111 express terme. The procurator who has such
special authority will 1113333113 exceptio 31 the 31113131331113331,
alleging general ageney, ‘si non mihi mandatum sit, ut a debitoribus
peterem,' by a replicatio alleging special instructions to 3113 him:
‘Aut si mihi mandatum est, ut a te peterem,’ Dig. 3, 3, 43.

If a woman acting as guarantor in contravention 31 Se Vellaeanum
sell and deliver her land to the creditor, she can renovet it back by
a real action; and meet the exceptio alleging sale and delivery by
a replicatio alleging the contravention 31 So Vellaeanum: ‘Aut si
ea venditio eontra senatusconsultum facta sit‚’ Dig. 16, 1, 32, 2.

Another text observes that an equality 31 delict on the part 31
3131113111 and defendant 13 more adverse to the plaintiff than to the
defendant (Cum par delictum 333 duorum, semper oneratur petitor
et melior habetur possessoris causa), e. g. an exceptio 31 the defendant
alleging fraud on the part 31 the plaintiff (exceptio doli) is not
allowed 33 be met by a replicatio 31 the latter alleging fraud on the
part 31 the defendant 31 the following kind: ‘Aut si 131 quoque in
ea re dolo actum sit,' Dig. 50, 17, 154.

The Replicatio, then, 11 we trust 311333 examples, was a proposition
beginning with the words ‘Aut si’ (31.1 126311 and, if this was
universal, we 1111133 suppose that the expression 31 Gaius, Sinon
postea convenerit ut eam 3331111331 331313 liceret, 1 126, only gives
the substance 311113 replicatio, not the precise terme in which it was
introduced by the praetor into the formula

11131311, Dig. 44, l, 2, 3, 3311111133, Dig. 27, 10, 7, 1, 2, differ
from Gaius in the uae 31 the words Duplicatio and Γ11131133313.
They identily Duplicatio with Replicatio, counting the pleas 113111
the exceptio; aud consequently use Triplieatio to signify an aver·
ment which Gaius would call Duplicatio. (Forexamples of formulae
containing Exceptio, Replicatio, Duplicatio, see Keller, C. P, § 37.)

5 130. The Praeseriptio in favour 31 the plaintiff became obsoleta
as soon as the old doctrine respecting litis consumptio was abrogated
and superseded by more rational rules respecting the operation 31

Res judicata, §§ 110-113, comm. In the Digest praescriptio has
become a mere synonym 31 exceptio.

§ 131. In connexion with 3113 praescriptio: Ea res agatur cujus
rei dies fuit, we may quote an anecdote which Cicero puts into the
mouth of Crassus in illustration of the groes ignoranee occasionally
displayed by the Roman advocate: Quid? his paucis diebus nonne,
nobie in tribunali Q. Pompeii praetoris urbani familiaris nostn' seden-
tibus, homo ex numero disertorum postulabat ut illi unde peteretur
vetus atque usitata exceptio daretur, eurus recurras 111113 russam?
