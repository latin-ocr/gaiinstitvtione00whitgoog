1111191961 VERBIS OBLIGATIO -333

The peculiar characteristic of Formal, that is to say, Verhal and

¹ Literal contracta, is this: evidentiary solemnities composa in 111000
1 contracte 01 indispensable part 01 the title 10 ajus 11 personam.
’ The Formless contracte, namely, the Real contracta, 01 which we

have already treated, and the Consensual contracte, 01 which we
shall treat hereatter, cannot, 01 course, he 01101001 in a 00111101 law
unless they are proved to have been concluded, unless, 11101 10,
evidence be gIven 01 their existence. But the 00111001 011 the
evidence 01 the 00111001 010 11011101 011 independent. In Formal

It was the formal 00111001 entered into by question 011 corre
sponding answer, called stipulatio, which 11000110 the general mode
01 contracting obligations in Roman law. The time 01 110 11110

in the references 10 that law, which have 00110 down 10 1011011
Roman 111100, 01100 0 binding form 01 00111001 11 was probably
notin existence till a somewhat later period. 'l'he earliest definite
11000 01 11 10 11 the Lex Aquilia 201110, which contains 0 special
provision concerning additional parties 10 0 stipulation, called adsti-
pulatores, §115. Various suggestions have been made by modern
writers 10 explain the origin 01 the stipulation. (See, 101111000 and
1011110 literature 01 the subject, Muirhead’s Roman 11011139.)
'Phe idea that the stipulation developed in some way out 01 nexum is

spondeo, question and answer were first used 101 religione purposes,
and subsequently adopted by law 00 a means 01 entering into a legal

stiprdation was at first confined to cases 11 which certa pecunia 01
certa res was thus promised, though afterwards it was applicable
aleo 10 uncertain claime, 1110 001101 being condictio, which was stricti
juris. But the characteristic 01 the stipulation, which made it in
course 01 time a 10111 101 creating any kind 01 obligation, was that
the promise contained init, though unilateral, might be conditional.
A condition was not annexable to all dispositione.

It was annexahle to all [testamentary dispositions; but among
formal dispositions inter 11100 the only 010 10 which it could be
annexed was formation 01 00111001 by stipulation.
