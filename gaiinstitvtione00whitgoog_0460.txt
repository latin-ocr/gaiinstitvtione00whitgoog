400 DE OBLIGATIONIBVS [111. 00 168-181.

(b) Litie contestatio made an exception to the latter rule in respect
of the ancient institution 01 Usucapio; which though 000 interrupted
by litis contestatio, did not entitle the defendant to absolution, as
litis contestatio made it revocabis, Dig. 6, 1, 18. Longi temporis
praescriptio, like other forms oi Presoription, was interrupted by litis
contestatio, or, in later times, by Insinuatio: and from Ood. 7, 33,
10 and Ood. 7, 40, 2, 01110 000010 to have been the result when
Justinian transformed longi temporis possessio into Usucapion.
Savigny, however, ξ 261, and Vangerow, ξ 160, bold that then the
rule of Prescription was in this respect supersederi by the rule of
Usucapion: that litis contestatio or insinuatio produced, that is to
say, not interruption but liability to revocation. (As to this
difference between Usucapio and longi temporis possessio, see
Grueber’s Lex Aquilia, p. 240, and Windscheid's Pandelrten, ξ 180,
note 7.)

(c) Litis contestatio produced another exception 00 the 0110 10 0110
event of the destruction of the subject of litigation by casualty (casus).
In 11001 actions 11 the defendant is a Mala fide possessor: in Personat
actions if 110 10 0 debtor chargeable with mora, destruction 01 0110
subject, although ascribable to Casus, and notwithstanding the
maxim r Impossibilium nonest obligatio : does not save the defendant
from condemnation. In the absence of 111010 fides and Mera, casual
destruction 01 the subject entitles the defendant, in virtue 010110
above maxim, 00 absolution.

(d) Litis contestatio makes transmissible a right 01 000100 which
before was untransmissiblc‚ 4 ξ 112, 0011101. Vindictive actions
(actiones vindictam spirantes), so long as there has bean nolitis
contestatio, are incapable of active transmission3 ie. transmission
to the heir 01 the plaintiff ε and penal actions are incapable 01 passive
transmission; i. 0. 0100001100100 to the heir 01 0110 defendant. But
when once litis contestatio has taken place, these actions, in the
event 01 the subsequent death 01 0110 plaintiff 01 defendant, become
capable respectively 01 active and passive transmission.

(c) In 00 action arising from delict when a man is only suablc to
the extent of his enrichment 'thereby, the question whether he ie
enriched or not is decided entirely by his circumstances at the moment
01 11010 contestatio.

It was stated that as a general rulo the plaintiti's title to judgment
was required to be in existence before litis contestatio. This is sub
jeot to exception in respect of some of the subordinate elementa 01
01010, 0010010 minor conditione 01 judgment in his favour which agree
