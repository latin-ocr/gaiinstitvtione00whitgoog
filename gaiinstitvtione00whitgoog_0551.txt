obligations ex fide bona. From the antithesis cf strictum jus and
bona fides it might be imagined that trust, confidence, credit, reliance
on good faith, were entirely foreign to civil obligations, and were only
ingrediente in equitable obligations. This isthe reverseof the truth.
Greater confidente (fides) is involved in mutui datio, greater rislr is
incurred by the ohligee, who starts by alienating his property and
‘making it the property of the obligor, who denudes himself, that is,
of the remedy of vindicatio, than in any other of tha real contracte,
most of which leave the promisee, even before the invention of
personal actions, armed, ii need be, with the legal remedy of·
vindicatio. Other real contracte we can imagine left to the pro·
tection of the moral code, to the forum of conscience, to the sanction
of public opinion, at a time when the immense confidenee implied
in a loan for consumption made the enforcement of this contract by
strict legal process a matter of practical necessity. (of. on this
subject Muirhead, Roman Law, ἐξ 8, 12.)

When the short, sharp, and decisive remedy of a civil action had
once been invented for mutui datio, the ingenuity of eontracting
parties and jurists would soon extend the remedy to other relations
by means of a fiction of mutui datio. Expensilation, then, and
Stipulation may be regarded as artifices for transferring agreements,
originally perhaps, from the ethical code to the legal code; but
certainly, in later times, from the laxer equitahle code to themora
rigorous civil code· A great part, however, of human dealings
refuses to ·be govemed by formal conditione, and prearranged, pre·
capitulated stipulatione. Hence alongside of stipulatio and expensi·
latio existed Real and Conseneual contracts; alongside of condictio
existed Judicis arbitrive postulatio, alongside of formulae stricti
juris existed formulae honae fidei

'Phe general difference between actions stricti juris and actions
bonae fidei consisted in the greater latitudo of discretion allowed to
the judge in the latter. 'Phe principal specific points of difference
were the followingz

(a) Actione stricti juris are based cn unilateral contracta, which only
ground an action for one of the parties: actions bonae fidei are based
on bilateral contracte, on which both parties can bring actio directa ; or
on semi-bilateral contracte, on which one party can bring actio directa,
and the other actio contraria So one-sided were condictione or
actions stricti juris that before the time of Marcus Aurelius a
setoff or counterclaim of the defendant (compensatio) could not be·
pleaded except as a ground of absolution in the form of Exceptio doli.
Inst. 4, 6, ³0.

(b) Actione stricti juris are governed by a literal interpretation of
the words of a disposition: in actions bonae fidei the judge inquires
