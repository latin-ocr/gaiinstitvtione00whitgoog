* troversy mentioned in § 28, where we see that itis doubtful whether

As in the two latter functione 01 supplementing and correcting

the law, the praetor did what is elsewhere performed by courts 01
equity, we have sometimes translated the contrasted terme henes

and bonorum possessor hythe terme ‘legal successor or heir’ and
ἵ ‘equitable successor or heir.’

'l'he claim 01 an heir (heres) founded on a title at civil law was
called hereditatis petitio ; a claim founded on apraetorian title, 0. g.
cognatiori, was pursued by the Interdict Quorum bonorum, or, in the
latest period, by possessoris hereditatis petitio, Dig. 5, 5, 1. Such at

χ least is Savigny's view, who makes no essential difference between

the Interdiot Quorum bonorum and Possessoria hereditatis petitio.

, According to Vangerow, §509, and more recent writers, however,
τ the Interdict was confined to the purpose 01 obtaining Possession

κ actions being employed on account 01 other rights and liubilities, 101·

direct actions. Thus it was only at a comparatively late time that

³ Pcssessoria hereditatis petitio was allowed as a general means 01
l claiming the inheritance when a claimant (e. g. cognatus or emanci-

patus) had a praetorian title, corresponding 10 Hereditatis petitio,
