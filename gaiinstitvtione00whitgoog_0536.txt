531. The proceeding under the edict in Damni infecti was aa
follows: If A apprehended damage to his property from the down
fall of a dilapidated house (aedes vitiosae, ruinosae) belonging to B,
he might apply (postulare) to the praetor and, haring effu-med hia
case on cath, obtain an order that B should promise, with or without
aureties according to circumstances, tc indemnify Ain the event cl
the accident If B refused to promise, the praetor by a first 01001οε
put Α in possession, that is, gave him detention or custcdy of B‘s
house. If B still refused, the praetor by a second decree gave Δ ,
bonitary ownership, which time would convert by usucapion into ¹
quiritary ownership. This remedy, imposing the necessity of iu· ,
demnifying cr surrendering the cause of damage, was an imitation of
noxal actions, which compelled the father of a son or owner ofa ,
slave or of a beust that had injured a neighbour's property either tc η
make compensatiou or to surrender the author of the damage. (aar ¹
a detailed account of this proceeding, sec Roby, Bk. 4, ch. 8.)

Staple, a form of solemn coutract now disused.

ἕξ 33, 34. Gaius appears 30 have divided Fictious iuto two damea
those which made a reference from the formulas-y system to the
older system of procedure, and those which made a reference fram
rights protected by the praetor to rights recognized by the civil law.
The former class were not an extensior of the law, but only pre
servsd to a plaintiff the remedies which he otherwise would hare
lost by the change of procedure when statuteprooeas was abolished.
For instance, the fiction of Pignoris capio was employed to preserve
unimpeired the rights of the ravenue contractor and ae a measure for
assessing the damages to which he was entitled against a deiaulter.
We see by the statement made in ξ 33 about condictio, that a fiction
was 003 required in all cases for the purpose of transferring an action
from the old procedure to the new. But 00 information has come
down to us aa to the precise way in which this class of fiction was
- employed. (tf. Keller, ᾗ 18 n, 247 a, and § 25 0., 298.

The second class of fictione was an extension or reform of the law.
