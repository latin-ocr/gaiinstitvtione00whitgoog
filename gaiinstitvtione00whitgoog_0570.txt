just ae fatal to the creditor ae an exceptio peremptoria. It was
temporary, not in respect oi ite effecta, but of the limited period
during which it was at the command of the debtor. But after Zeno
such an exceptio was temporary in its effecte, and did not prevent
a renswal of the action after a certain lapse of time, thet is, astar
the expiration of the term originally fixed for the payment, arrd an
additional term measuring the temporal exoees of the plaintiff's claim.
J ustinian retained Zeno's lew in respect of Time, and disarmed the
other modes of plur petitio of their terrore, by merely making the
creditor liable to three times the amount of the loss that his exorbi-
tant claim hed caused ιο the debtor, particularly in respect of the
fees (sportulae) of the executive officere (executores), (iod. 3, 10, 2.

(55. A plaintiff who had made a misteke in the subject of h'u
claim was allowed by J ustinian ιο amend his claim without instituiing
a new action.

It seems from this paragraph that the title or ground of action
(eausa debendi) was sometimes specified in the Intentio. Perhaps
this was done in condictio ex testamento and actio exstipulatu, which
hed no Demonstratio, and then availed to prevent the consumptiou

, of the right of action3 thetis, the allegation of the ples of Res judicata
when the plaintiff afterwards claimed the earne suru but founded his
claim on a different title. Of. 5 131.

t 56. Α plaintiff whose intentio claimed less than he was entitled
to was allowed by Zeno to obtain the full amount without instituting
a new action, Inst 4, 6, 34.

(58. As plus petitio implies intentio certa, and the existence of
a demonstratio involves intentio incerta, it follows that excees in the
demonstratio cannot involve plus petitio. Again, as the demonstratio
does not determine what is the res in judicium deducta, a iales
demonstratio cannot consume the true ground of action.

§tiu It appears that some jurist had regarded the first clause of
en actio in factum, si paret . . . fecisse, as a demonstratio. Gaius
himself, in speaking of this clause, used ambiguous terme, nominato
eo quod factumest, ξ 46. Βιιι it ia clear from § 60 that he holds it
to be no Demonstratio, butan Intentio.

The plaintiff who lost au actio infactum did not, strictly speaking,
lose his right to bring another action, for novatio, or transformation
oi his original right into a right to have judgment, was only
operated by the commenoement of a personal action injus But
this made uo practical differenoe, for though his own right (ipsum
jus) was not extinguished‚ it was counterpoised hyan opposite right
of the defendant based on the claim having been brought to trial
(exceptio rei in judicium deductae or judicatae), which would cause ’
any suit instituted by the plaintiff to be dismissed.
