xiv HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION

§a Early Religious Low (Fam-The Leges Regiae—The
Secularizotc'cn of Low.

Α process, which runs pamllel with that which we have just de·
scribed, is the pmcess by which Roman Law cameto be secularized;
the process, that is, by which human were gradually substituted lor
divine sanctione. vhe customary law oi a primitive societyia either
identical with, or developed imm, some form of belief which implies
the omnipresence oi the gods and their detailed interest aud activity
in human affairs. In primitive Rome the pleading (actio) oi the
litigant in a civil suit ie a religious chant, every word and cadenee
of which must be learnt from the priest3 the wager (sacramentum),
by which the process is stated, isa gift to a temple, and is probably
conceived as an atonement for the involuntary perjury of the man
who loses his case13 the penalties of the criminal law are means of
expiating the anger of the gods, the severest form of atonement being
the sacrifice oi the sinner on the altar of the deity whom he has
offended ². Rome in the historical period still preserves many traces
of these beliefs of her infancy. They are found in the respect for
the Auspices, in the conservatism which maintained the cumbrous
forms of the old pleadings (actiones) and the custody ol these forms
by the Pontifical Collega ; in the varied methodo by which crinio or
sin is punished, some offences being reserved wholly for the secular
cauria others being visited by the judgments of the Pontifieal
Collega, others again being subject to the milder chastieement of the
Censor before he performs the religione rite of Purification (Lustratio).
But the belief ol the Romana themselves was that, in the very earliest
stages oi their recorded or imagined history, the primitive epoch of
complete subservience to religione forms, if it ever existed, had been
already passed, and that even in the time of the Kings something
approaching a clear line could be drawn between the iunctione of
Religious Law (Fas) and those cf Secular Law (J us). At the close oi
the history ol the Republic there could be shown, in contradistinction
td the great secular code ci the Twelve Tables, a collection of religious
ordinances', believed to be even more ancient than this code, and
known as the Laws of ¹the Kings (Leges Regiae) ³. These lawe are
not represented as having formed a code, but merely a compilation.
They were believed to be regal ordinances, issued by different Kings,
