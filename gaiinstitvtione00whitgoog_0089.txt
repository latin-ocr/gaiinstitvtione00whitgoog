writers to be earlier than the lex Aelia Sentia; thus Mommsen
(Staatsr. 3, 626) is inclined to put it backto the end of the free republic
(ef. Schneider, Zeitschr. d. Sar. Stiftung v. R. A. 1884). It defined
and modified the status conferred by such acts of private manu·
mioeion as were probably mentioned in this paragraph, converting
Praetoris tuitione liber into ipso jure liber, or possessio libertatis
into genuine libertas; with, however, sundry grievous stints and
deductione. Under this statute the fieedman was nominally assimi-
lated tc Latinus coloniarius, the citizen of a Romen colony in
Latium ; that is, had a moiety oi the private rights composing civitas
Romana cr jus Quiritium, possessing commercium withoutcon·
nubium. As incapable of connubium or civil marriage, the Latinus
was incapable oi patria potestas over his children and ol agnatio 'or
civil relationship. Though incapable of civil marriage he was of
course capable ol gentile marriage (matrimonium, uxorem liberorum
quaerendorum causa ducere) and of natural relationship (cognatio),
just as an alien (peregrinus), though, by want of commercium,
incapable of dominica ex jure Quiritium, was capable of bonitary
ownership (in bonis habere) under the jus gentium.

In virtue of commercium, the Latinus J unianus was capable oi
Quirites-y ownership, cf civil acquisition and alienation (usucapio,
mancipatio, in jure cessio), contraot (obligatio), and action (vindi-
catio, condictio), like aRcman citizen; but in respect of testamentary
succession his rights were very limited. He was said to have
testamentary capacity (testamenti factio), Ulpian, 20, 83 but this
only meant that he could perform the pert of witness, cr familiae
emptor, or libripens (2 § 104), ie. could assist another person to
make a ralid will; not that he could take under a will either as
heir or as legatae, or could dispoee of his own property by will,
Ulpian, 20, 14. At his death all his property belonged to his
patron, aa if it were the peculium cf a slave, 3 ξὸδ. In fact, as
Justinian says: Licet ut liberi vitam suam peragebant, attamen
ipso ultimo spiritu simul animam atque libertatem amittebant,
Inst. 3, 7, 4. ‘Though free in their lifetime, the same moment
that deprived them of life reduced them to the condition of slaves.'

Although in the person cf libertus himself, Latinitas retained
many traces of its servile origin, yet it was not so for his posterity;
these disabilities only attached to the original freednaan, not to his
haue 'l'he son of the dediticius or Latinus Junianue, though

* reduced to absolute penury by the confiscation of the parental
property to the patron, began, and continued, the world with
the ordinary capacities, respectively, ol peregrinus and Latinus
teloniarius, and was under no legal obligations to the patron cf his

lether.
