market value. Early law does not include more than the market
value 01 the thing, but in course of time a wider view is taken 01 the
plaintiffs interest (Grueber, Lex Aquilia, p. 265).

Where a claim is founded on some kinds 01 contract, saya contract
of insurance against some kind of loss, the marhot valae 01 the thing·
lost is generally intended, though this of course depende on the
nature and terme 01 such contmct: in this case the loss 01 the plain·
tiff does not include the damages he has indirectly experienced
(damnum indirectum] nor the gain he has failed to realize (lucrum
cessans). When a claim of indemnification 10 founded on delictor
00 breach ofa contract‚ 11 this is not contrary to the intention
of the parties, the plaintifl's interest 10 the measure of the indemnity
10 be pald, and includes not only the immediate damage that he has
suffered, but also the mediate, when it was certain and capable of
being loressan: and not only the positive loss which he hae suffered
but also thegein which he has been hindered from realizing. If a
creditor has been kept out 01 0 sum 01 money, he will at least be
entitled to the current rate 01 interest: but this is not the 11101101
his claim, if he can prove that the current rate of interest is insuffi-
cient to cover the specific disadvantage he has suffered from the

however, is one of the exceptione to the rule. Here, in consequence,
probably, 01 the peculiar wording of the edict, the measure of damages,
the simplum or unit to be quadrupled, is not the plaintiff's interest
but themarlret value, Dig. 47, 8, 2, 13, Savigny, System, Appendix 12.

Instanoes 01 indirect damages due to the act or omission ofa
defendant, are: the depreciation of the remaining horsea of a team
when one has been killed: the penal sum which 0 plaintiff 10 liable

Although 10 respect of computation of damages claime of indemnity
founded on breach 01 contract, whether in consequence of dolus or
