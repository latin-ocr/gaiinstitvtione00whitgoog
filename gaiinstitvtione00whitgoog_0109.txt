were sufficient in other cases to constitute delivery cf possession,
Dig. 41, 2, 18, 2. ‘Ifa vendor deposit any article in my house by
my order, I have possession of it though 1 heve never touched
it' Consensue, then, in the abore-quoted passage, is not opposed
to delivery of possession, but to cohabitation, or to the use oi
certain words or certmn documenta or to the solemn end grace-
ful ceremonial with which custom surrounded the matrimonial
umora

Real contracte, however, are executory on one side and executed
, on the other, whereas in the conjugal relation both parties are on
the same footing in respect of execution3 and we may ask whether
, marriage is a contract at all; whether it does not rather fall under
ζ the opposite categoryof alienation or conueyance. Instead of finding
its analogon in locatieconductio cr societas (eonsensual contracte)
or pignus or commodatum (real contracte), may we not rather, with
Savigny, find it in transfer of dominion or other creatione of real
right, such as adoption, the concession of petria potestas, or emanci-
pation? This seems the truer view, and if we use the expression,
marriage contract, we must use the term coutract not in a specific
sense, as opposed to conveyance, but in the generic sense of
bilateral disposition (aa opposed to unilateral disposition, e. g. testa·
tion), a sense embracing both contract proper and conveyauce‚ and
extending beyond the sphere of Property inte the relations of
domestic life. Contract proper and conveyanoe, though generally
conhasted in jurisprudence, have much in common. If contract
in its narrower sense is defined to be tho concurrenoe of two
manifestatione of will creating a jus in personam, and conreyance
the concurrence cf two manifestatione of will creating ajus in
rem, the concurrence oi two manifestatione of will creating a jus
ie an clement common to both terme of the comparison, and this
common clement may be denominated in a generic sense a con·
tract. Contract in the narrower sense may then be distinguished
aa an obligative contract and conveyance as a translative contract,
aud the latter head will include the contract of marriage, if we
continue to employ this expression.

As in respect of property or dominion we find in Roman lew the
distinction of Quiritary and Bonitary, that is, of civil and gentile,
ownership, so in respect of the conjugal relation we find the distino-
tion of Roman or civil marriage (connubium, justae nuptiae, justum
matrimonium) and gentile marriage (nuptiae, matrimonium), of
which the former alone was valid at civil law (connubium eet uxoris
jure ducendae facultas, Ulpian, 5, 3; ‘connubium ie the capacity of
manage valid by civil law ⁹) and capable of producing patria potestas
aad agnatio, though the latter produced legitimate children (justi
