jus gentium οι· natural law. Menova, the law of guardianship
has been most variable, not only if we look to different countries,
but also if we look at different periods in the same country;
and the praetor or chancellor or other authority that has had the
supervision of guardians has always exercised a gnead latitudo of
discretion; features which again forbid us tc ascribe the rules of
wardship to any comparatively immutable code oi nature. Tutela
was in fact an old Roman institution, by which the gens or familia
maintained control in its own interest over its weaker members‚
who were not subject to patria potestas It is possible that this
control was at first exclusively exercised hythe gens, in whom the
ownership ol all land occupied by the gentiles may have been vested,
¹ and that agnatio as well aa testamentary guardianship was first
instituted by the law of the Twelve Tables, wheneby patriciana and
plebeians were put on an equalityin reopant of private rights. That
the gens was in the habit of taking charge in some way ol lunatice
and insane persons we know imm the words of the Twelve Tables,
which have come down to us—‘Si furiosus exit, ast ei custos ne
exit, adgnatssm gentiliumque in eo pecuniaque eius potestas eet!
