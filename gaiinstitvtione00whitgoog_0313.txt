5254. By the Sc. Trebellianum, if the whole beneficial interest

’ in an inheritance was transferred, the whole right of suing and

being sued passed to the transferres: if only a portion of the bene·
ficial interest was transferred, both the transferror and the trans·
ferree could sue and be sued in thesemo proportion. But if the
whole or almost the whole inheritance is to be transferred to another
the heir has little or no iuducement to enter upon it, on which
account the trust may fail with the other provisions of the will.
Hence the Sc. Pegasianum, passed in the reign of Vespasian,

¹ a.. a. 70-76, apparently provided that when less than a fourth of the
’ inheritance is left to the benefit of the fiduciary heir, he should still

be entitled to retain his fourth, the So. Trebellianum being then
inoperative, that is to say, that in such a case the actions by or
against the inheritance shall not be maintainable by or against both
the heir and the transferree in the proportion of their interests, but

l should be exclusively maintainable by or against the heir. Iu fact,
l having subjected the transferres to the liability of abatement which
l the lex Falcidia imposed on the legatae, it seemed logical to put

him in all other respeots on the footing of a legatae, or singular
successor, including the immunity from being sued and incapacity of

s suing for the debts of the succession. If then the fiduciary heir,

retaining his fourth, became thus sole administrator, the Sc. Pegasi·

, anum directed him and the transferres to enter into the covenants
ζ mual between an heir aud a partiary legates. The heir promised,
³ in tho event of an underestimate, to make an additional payment;

and the transferres promised, in the event of an overestimate, to
make a proportional repayment. Α partiary legates is alegatee by
partition, which Theophilus calls a fifth form of legacy, and of
which Ulpian gives the formula, 24, 25. ‘As single things can be
bequeathed, so can a universality, for instance thus: Do thou, my
heir, partition and divide my inheritance with Titius ; in which case
a moiety is deerned to be bequeathed, but any other part, a third
or fourth, may be bequeathed, and this form of bequest is called
partition' This form of legacy probably owed its on'gin to the lex
Voconia, ξ 226, which forbade Classicus to make an heiresa

3257, 258. The subject is not very clearly explained by (laius,
but it would soem that after the Sc. Pegasianum was passed, the
principle of the So. Trebellianum continued to apply, if as much as
a quarter of tha estate was reserved to the heir by the metator ; thus
the inheritance with its rights and duties would bc divided pro parte
between the heir and the transferres. But if the heir was left less
than one fourth, his relation to the transferres, if he accepted the
