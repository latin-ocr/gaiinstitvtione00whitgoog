before A. ae defendant was put to prove the existente of the eervi-
tude: whereas, if Ahad been pleintifi‚ A would have had to beginhy
proving the existenoe of the servitude beforeB was put to hisansrrer.

So viee versa: ii B had originally wished to provehis rightto
build ae plaintiff, either in an aetio Negatoria of jus Nou altine
tollendi, or in an aetio confessoris of jus altius tollendi; and if
A had deelined to defend either aetion by giving eeourities, &a in
the oourae prescribed by lam Α would have been restrained from
afterwards interiering with Β exeept as plaintiff in a suit in which
B was made defendant, Dig. 39, 1, 15. cf. 2, §i 1-14, §528-89,
eomm, §i 1-9, oomm.

At alater period, aewehare seen, the nautio judioatum solriwasnot
required fromthe defendantinarealaotion, and translatiopoeseesionie
might be averted if the defendant merely gave the nautio judicio sisti.

'I'he sum staked in the praedes sacramenti, whioh Gaim had told
ue, i 14, was a thousand or five hundred esses, he now, i 95, define
ae one hundred and twenty-five seeteroee.

'l'he explanation of this ie as follows: Originally the sestertius, as
the name implies, was two asses and a half, and the denarius ten
asses. Both the sestertius and the denarius were silver ooins. ln
the Second Punic War, about no. 21⁷, in oonsequenee of the ineol-
venoy of the State, the denarius was made equal to sixteen asses and
the sestertius remained, as before, one fourth of the denarius, matis
became equal to four essee. One hundred and twenty-five sesterom,
therefore, were equal to five hundred asses This change was brought
about by the lex Orepereia.

The Sponsio praejudicialis, though giving riae toa personal aetion
in form, might in effect be a meane of deoiding a real aetion. It re·
semblee eomewhat the Feigned Iesue or issue in a fiotitious aetion on
awager, whereby the court of Ohanoery, before it had the poweroi
summoning ajury, might refer en issue of feet to trial by jury, or the
parties in a court of law by ooneent or hy direotion of some aet oi
parliament might determine some disputed right without the formality
oi e regular aetion, thereby saving mueh time and expenee; see Blael·
stone’s eommennries. In the Sponeio poenalis there was botha
sponsio and restipulatio, that ie, both parties forfeited the pennl erun
if they lost the aetion, and the penal eum might be serious, in an
aetion de pecunia eerta eredita being one third, end in an aetion da
peeunia eonstitute being one heli of the eum in disputo, 5 171.

In the aetio Sacramenti in rem and per Sponsionem two different
stipulatione must be distinguished. ln the Seoramentum there was
(A) the praedes sacramenti, and (B) the praedes litis et vindiciarum,
ξ 16 ; in the aetio in rem per Sponsionem there was (A) the sponsio
praejudicialis and (Β) the satisdatio pro praede litis et vindiciarum,
