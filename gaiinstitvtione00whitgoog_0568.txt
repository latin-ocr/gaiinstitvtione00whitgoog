. disinheritance, preterition, inofficiositas, legaoies, &ct yet there are
some clemente of a will to which other lewe must be applied. 'l'ha
capacity oi the testator (testamenti factio, commercium) must exist
both at the dote ol executing the will and at the data of his deceass: ,
and must be tested at the former date by the law oi his then domicil
Again the capacity ol honoratus (heir or legatae) isgoverned by the law
of the domicil of honoratus at the time of the testator's death. Indead
in Roman times, though not in modern Ger-many, this capacity was
required at tria tempora, the making ol the will, the death oi the
testator', and the acquisitio by honoratus, 2 οξ 109-114, comm, and 3
was governed at each period by the law oi his then domicil. ἒ
, 'Phe capacity of a parson ior contracting and otherwise disposing Ξ
is govemed by the law of hio nationality or domicil: with this
reservation, that Majority once attained cannot be directed in respect l
of past acts ογ a mere change of domicil: by settling, that is to say,
in a new domicil where majority comes later.

The validity of the Form of any disposition (contract marriage,
testament, &cl may depend on the law by which the substance ottho
disposition is governed (the law of the stipulated place of perform
anca, the law oi the husband’s nationality or domicil, the law oi the
testator’s domicil at the time of makinghiswill). But inconveniences Ξ
would arise isthis law were exclusive. For instance, a German will ¹
can only be made with the assistance oi a court In Franoe no court
is authorised to give its assistance to the execution of a will,
which is the fonction of the Notary. Α German, then, domiciled
in Germany but dying in Franco, would be unable to executa a will
ii he could only do it in the form prescribed ογ German law.
Accordingly, as an alternative to the law that govems the disposi-
tion, the law oi the ploce where the disposition is made is accepted:
and the iorm oi a disposition is valid if it satisfias either the proper
law ol the disposition or the law citha territory in which the die·
position is made. 'l'he applicability oi the latter law is expreffled
by the maxim: Locus regit actum. We must except the forma ol
Alienation which must always satisFy the lex rai sitae.

Procedure is governed by the law ol the lorum where a suitia
instituted. Dilatory exceptione, accordingly, as based merely on rules
of procedure, depend on the law oi the forum. But the material
contentione of the deleme, that is, the rights oi the defendant,
whether ipso jure extinctive, or per exceptionem peremptoriam
counteractive, oi the rights of the plaintiff, are gevemed hythe
same law as the rights of the plointiff ; thetis by the local law
that governs the obligation 'Phe Exceptio Sc. Macedoniani and sc
Vellaeani, however, as relating to personal capacity, are governed
by the law of the domicil of the person in question.
