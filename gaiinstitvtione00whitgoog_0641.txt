5 onon 111 aas 11 11010111 annm varrssnr, De Oratore, i. 37. ‘A few
¹ days ago when I was sitting as assessor 01 the praetor urbanus, the
defendant's advocate pressed the praetorto insert in the formula
the old and common exception: 11 1110111111 1111101 01 rna rnr-
11111 manans nun, not lrnowing that it only protected the plain-
siff, saving him, if his de'mand was proved 10 be premature, from
, being barred ina subsequent action by the exception of rnnvrous

When mancipation was the usual mods of transfening property
in immorables and was complete without delivery of possession,
and when, further, the rules of litis consumptio prevailed, a plaintiff
would occasionally need the praescriptio: Ea res agatur de fundo
mancipando. ξ 131 a. Ata later period transfer of possession (tra-
ditio) became the only means of transferring property, and the rules
of res in judicium deducta (lis contestata), as we have seen, undcrwent
a reform.

Praescriptio longi temporis, in the legislation 01 Justinian, is in
principle equivalent to Usucapio, though the term usucapio is only
used for the acquisition of movable things by possession for three
years. This arose in the following manner. A proprietor's right
to recover by vindicatio might at an early period be barred by an
averment of adverse possession, during ten years, if the parties were
domiciled in the same province, during twenty years, if they were
domiciled in different provinces (longi temporis possessio). This
exceptio of the defendant appeared in the formula in the shape and
under the name of a praescriptio (pro reo), which is so called on
account 01 the place it once occupied in the formula, cf. 1 133. When,
by later legislation, longi temporis possessio accompanied with bona
fides became a title whereby property was acquired, it still retained
its original name 01 praescriptio. The term Exceptio longi temporis
was a misnomer, because the averment 01 title by prescription was
not an Exceptio but a Negatio 01 the plaintift's ownership, i. e.
belonged 11 the second line 01 dafenes. Bethmann·Hollweg, § 154.

would not oontain the word incertum but the substance of the con-
