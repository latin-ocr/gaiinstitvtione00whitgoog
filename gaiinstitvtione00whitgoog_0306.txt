246 DE FIDEIOOMMISSIS [ιι. §t 246-259.

to the date of the promises i. e. the obligation of 'the' promiser and
the right ol the promisee date from the conclusion of the contract
as if it had been originally unconditional. Though an unconditional
legacy was liable to bo defeated by the heres 'declining the iuberi-
tance‚ or the will lrom any other cause failing ol operation, yet, as
soon as the validity oi the will was ascertaiued by the aditio oi the
heres, the vestiug of an unconditionnl legacy dated beck from the
opening oi the will, or the death of the testator.

One of the Oatos was the author of a maxim, that to test the
validity of a legacy we must examine whether it would be valid
if the testator died immediately after executing his will. 'I'his was
called regula Catoniana, Dig. 34, 7, 1 pr. The retroactive effect
of the removal of an original impediment to the validity of a title
is called the convalescence oi the title. Accordingly, Oato’s rule
may bc described as a rule denying the convalescence ol legacies.
Gato's rulo, however, was only a criterion ol the velidity of uncon-
ditional bequests; the validity ol conditional bequests oen only be
tested when the condition is accomplished Accordingly, of the
three opinions mentioned in this paragraph, that of Sabinus is to be
regarded as seond, and is so treated by J ustinian, Inst. 2, 20, 32.
