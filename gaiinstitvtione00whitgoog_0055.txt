NEW METHODS OF PROOEDURE xlix

ceses, ir he willed; but his jurisdiction was always voluntury3 and,
iihe declined to act, the case went before the Praetor. In oriminal
matters, two high courts of voluntary and extraordinary jurisdiction
were created-that of the Princeps and that of the Senate. The
Princeps might take any case, but often limited his interventionis
crimes committed by imperial servants or by efficere of the army.
'l'he jurisdiction oi the Senate was especially concerned with offences

committed by members of the upper ranks of society, or with
crimes of a definitely political character.

The system oi appesl introduced by the Principete was of a
complicated character, and many oi its features are imperiectly
understood. It seems thet, at Rome, the Princeps could in civil
matters veto, and perhaps alter, the decision oi a Praetor, but could
not annul the verdict of a «luder, except by ordering a new trial ¹.
He could or course vary the decisione of his own delegatos in matters
ot entraordinury jurisdiction. In ciiminal matters the Princeps
does not seem to have had the power ef altering the decisione of the
Qumtiones Perpetuae; but he could probably order a new trial ¹.
There was technically no right of appeal irem the Senate to the -
Princeps⁸3 but the Princeps could exorciso what was practically a
power os pardon by vetoing the decisione of the senate invirtue of
his Tribunicia Potestas In the provincial world, the right of
appeal was at first regulated in accordance with the distinction
between Gaesar's provinces and the provinces of the Remanpeople.
hcm Gessar’s provinces the appeal lay to Cassan irom the other
provinces it cameto the Consule and, at least if it was concerned
with a criminal matter, was by them transmitted te the Senate.
But we know that this system of dual jurisdiction was breaking
down even in the first century of the Principate, and that the
appellate jurisdiction of the Princeps was tending to encroech on
that of the Gonsuls and Senate ⁴. The extent to which it had broken
down in the time of Gaius is unknown. But we know that, by the
end of the second century A.1>., the Princeps was the Court oi
Apped lor the whole provincial world. For this purpose he was
usually represented by the Prosect of the Praetoriae Guard.
