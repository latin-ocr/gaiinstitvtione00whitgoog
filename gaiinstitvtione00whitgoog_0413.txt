the nature of Oorrcality before we cmbark on the consideration ot
the various forms of Guaranty.

Correality, the multiplicatiori of creditores (plures rei credendi) or
debitores (plures rei debendi) in a single obligation without a corre·
sponding division of the Object of the right or obligation, was an
institution of Roman law in favour ot creditors; whereby, excep-
tionally and usually in virtue ot a special agreement, each creditor
was severally entitled to recovcr the whole (solidum) object ot the
obligation from a common debitor, or each debitor was severally liable
to pay the whole object of the obligatior to a common creditor.
'l'he ordinary rulo, to which Correality forms an exception, is that

’ when there arc many creditores or many debitores in an obligation,

tho Object of the obligatior is correspondingly divided; so that each
creditor is only entitled to recover a proportional fraction of the
advantage and each debitoris only bound to bear a proportional
hachen of the burdes. In Correality each creditor is secerclly
entitled to receive, and each debtor is ceveratty bound to discharge,
the whole Object ol the obligatior. Bytho ordinary rulo, the
creditore would be only jotnttp entitled to receive the whole object;
and this the debtors would be only ,totally bound to discharge 3 each
creditor would bc scocrolty entitled to receive onlya ratable part of
tho Object ot the obligation, and a ratable part of the Object is
all that each debtor would be swerctty bound to discharge. By
