'Phe interdict or command 11 the magistrate, like the law or
command 11 the legislator, hae two membcre (protasis or minor

promise, and apodoeis 11 conclusion); or two terma, an antecedent
(a title expreseed by the middle term B) and a consequent (an

obligation expressed by the major term Α). The antecedent term ie
usually introduced by a relative (Quorum bonorum, Unde dejecisti,
Uti possidetis, 111.) equivalent to a Si: accordingly any interdict may
be paraphraeed by the proposition: If such and euch antecedent title

defiance 11 the magisteria} interdict: but in more orderly periods
hoth parties would be deeiroue of trying their right by legal course,
and the steps taken by both would be prearranged with a view 11
