on the general nature of conditione. Α Condition is an clement
of Title; itis a certain contingent occurrence or non-occurrence,
performance or non-performance, by arbitrary appointment con·
forring on a certain person a certain right, or imposing on him
a certain duty. It may be defined as the middle term (B) of a
syllogism of which the minor term (0) represents a person, and the
major term (A) a right or duty, and of which both the premissos
are contingent. It is the last feature that we shall first proceed to
consider.

The major premiss must be contingent; it must be an arbitrary
determination that makes the right or duty (A) depend on the
given title (Bp the nexus between the middle and major terme
must be solely the will of tho testator or contractors, not the will
of the legislator3 the t'tle must not be in its own nature the Neces-
sary presupposition of the right. E. g. in the following cases: the
institution of a person as heir, iste survive the testator, a'f be accept
tac interficerem the bequest of a legacy, is the heir accept the in·
hoctenem the promise of a dower, istite marriage is celebrated· the
seeming condition is required by the law, and its expression is
superfluous: such an event, therefore, is not a genuine condition.
Again, the nexus between the minor and middle terms may be
either the will of the person entitled (conditio potestativa), cod. 6,
51, 7, or chance (conditio casualis); but one way or other the
minor premiss must be contingent3 the fulfilment of the condition
must be neither Necessary nor Impossible: it must be a future and

uncertain contingency whether the title (B) shall be realized or ful· ¹
filled in respect of s given person (0). The condition, accordingly, ,

must not be a past or present event, e. g. if Titius was consul last year,

tf Titius ts new camach such a fact is now certain and Necessery, ¹

and any disposition contingent thereon is really unconditional.

The effect of an Impossible condition is different in Contracts
and Testamentary dispositions; it invalidates contract3 whereas in
atestament it is deemed unvvritten (pro non scripte habetur), and
the disposition is regarded as unconditionel. This was the rule
that finally prevailed, Dig. 35, 1, 3. ‘It has been finally decided
that impossible conditione to testamentary dispositione are mere
surplusage! This was the doctrine of the Sabinians, and was
confirmed by Justinian, inst. 2, 14, 10. Illegal and immoral con·
ditione followed the same rule as impossible conditione. The
question why Contracts and Wills were governed by different mles,
which Gaius admits to be obscure, may receive some light from the
following consideratione. Testamentary dispositione in their nature
are acts of liberality on the part of the testator. Even when he
employs them as inducements to an illegal or immoral act, itis not
