(a) Adoptio gave to the adopted child, in addition to his original
civitas, that ol his adoptive father.

(4) Adiectio, election by the governing body oi a community,
admitted strangers to civitas.

It follows that a man might be a citizen of several states ; of one
by origo, another by adoptio, another by adlectio. This may seem
to be contradioted by Ciceroz Duarum civitatum civis esse noster
jure civili nemo potest, Pro Balbo,¹ 11, 28: but Cicero is here speaking
'of independent sovereign states; not of the dependent states corn·
posing the organism oi the Roman empire.

When Roman citizenship had been granted to all Italy, and an
ordinance of Caracalla, subsequent to the time of Gaius, had ex·
tended it to all the Provinoes, every member of any municipality
possessed at least a double citizenship: he was citizen of Rome
as well as of the smaller municipalityc Omnibus municipibus· duas
esse censeo patrias, unam naturae, alteram civitatis. . . habuit
alteram loci patriam, alteram juris, Cicero, De legibus, 2, 2. Roma
communia nostra patria est, Modestinus, Dig. 50, 1, 33.

'l'he principal effecte of citizenship in a municipality were three·
sold:

(1) Obligation to bear certain burdeneome municipal offiees
(munera);

(a) Subjection or obligation of submissior to the municipal
magistrates and tribunale, including liability as defendant to be
sued before its courts (forum originis);

(3) Subjection to municipal lawe, including the determination of
a man's personal capacity-infancy, minority, majority, capacity of
disposition, &ce-by the laws of the community in which he had
civitas (lex originis).

In all these effeots a man's Roman citizenship was of slight
importancc compared with his municipal citizenship. 'Phe burdens
(munera) of the metropolitan city were provided for by arrange
ments peculiar to Rome. The liability of a defendant to be sued
before a Roman forum was limitsd to the time when he happened
to be resident in Rome, and then was subject to many exceptione,
included under the general name of jus revocandi domum: and in
any case oi collision between the lawe relating to personal capacity,
the laws of Rome always yielded to those of the lecal patria or
father town (lex originis).

In mort of the above consequences Domicil (domicilium, inco·
latus, domus) had an operation similar te civitas. Domicil is the
place which a man has voluntarily chosen ior his residenee, as
