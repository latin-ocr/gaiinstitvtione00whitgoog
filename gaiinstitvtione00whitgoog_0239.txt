11. tt 97-108.] DE TESTAMENTIS ORDINANDIS 179

, Rome cf the civil and military organisation, may be regarded as the

legislative act of the curiae in military convocation. The essential
characteristic cf this will was the nominatiora oi a heres Hence so
important became the institution ofa heres to the validity of a will

’ in Roman law, that a Roman testament might be simply defined

aethe institution oi a heres.

¹ The mancipatory will, or will by bronze aad scala probably began

to supersede the older form, which was perhaps confined to patriciana,
when the Twelve Tables gave legal force tc the nuncupative part oi
mancipation (Cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncu·
ζ pessit, ita jus estc, Festus. ‘In centract or conveyance by bronze
³ and balance, the cral declaration shall have legal force Ἰ, and had ea·
pmselyrecognized in every paterfamilias‚whether patrician cr plebeias,

, apewer of testamentary disposition (Uti legassit super [familia],
¹ pecunia, tutelave suae rei, ita jus esto. Ulpian, ll, 14).
² The introduction of writing marks an era in mancipatory wille.

Originally, the testator gave oral instructions to the familiae emptor,

r or purchaecr of the family property, in the presence ot the witnesees‚
i 88 to the terms on which the property was to be held by him and

a distributedaiter thetestatcr'c death. These cral instructions, forming
κ the lex mancipii, or conditione cf the conveyance, called nuncupatio,

sarred as amsans, under the clauses of the Twelve Tables above cited,
ζ of nominating a heres. Hence a special lex curiata for this purpose
was no longer necessary, and the familiae emptor, instead of being a

' lind oi trustee for carrying out the testator's wishes, became a mere
κ formality, used simply for the purpose cf making the will mancipatory.

³ to writing, and the nuncupation became a mere torm of publication,

the testator held in his hand, when he executed the mancipation.

validity cf a will should be incompetent ae a witness; and, when
the familiae emptor was in the place of the heir, it was reasonable
io disquaIiTy fer attestaticn any one united in interest to him. But
when the mancipaticn was purely fictitious (imagInaria mancipatio,
Ulpian, 20, 2 3 imaginaria venditio, Inst. 2, 10,1),onescetercc being
pail as the nominal price, and the imaginary vendee distinct from
the heir, the continuance of this disqualification shows the tendency
of the Romans tc venerate rules after the principles on which they
were founded had oeased to operate. In the meantime the heir,

κ who was, strictly speaking, really interesse, was competent to be
, arieneos. Cicero, for instance, mentions tlrat he and Clodius were

both witnesses to a will in which they were appointed heire, Pro
lilone, 18, 483 but in the time of Gaius, as we see bytho text,
