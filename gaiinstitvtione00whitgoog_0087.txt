1811322] DE LIBERTINIS 25
i {orm oi will was introduced, 2 t 102, aeuum retained their power

ol manumission, although the people here at the utmost were
only symbolically represented hythe witnesses of a mancipation.
Bequests of liberty were either direct or indirect A direct bequest
oi liberty (directo data libertas) made the manumitted slave a heed-
mau of the testator (libertus orcinus, Inst. 2, 24, 2): an indirect
bequest, that is, araqueet to the heir to manumit the slave (fidei-
, comminantia libertas), made the slave on manumission a ireednran
of the heir, 2 1266.

ξ 18. 'l'he lox Aelia Sentis passed in the reign oi Augustus, s.1>. 4,
and named after the consuls Sextus Aelius Catus and Gaius Sentius
Saturnium was intended to throw obstacles in the way oi aequir-
ing Roman citizenship (Sueten. Aug. 40). One oi its enactmente
provided that s slavo under the age of thirty could not be made
a citizen unless manumitted by vindicta, after proof of adequate
motiva before a certain judicia} board. We may inquire what would
be the effect cl manumission ii the causae probatio were omitted.
Inscription on tbe censor's register, ii iu use, would probably bave
been null and void, acthis ceremony was either s mode oi making
alternari citizen or it was nothing. Testamentary manumission, aa
we leam from Ulpiae, 1, 12‚1e1t the man legally a slave, but gave
him actual liberty (possessio libertatis, in libertate esse, as opposed
tc libertas), a condition recognized and protectcd by the praetor.
lienumission by vindicta lelt him still a slave (according to the
us, of Ulpian, ib. the slave ol Caesar). Either the lex Aelia Sentia
or lex Junia, it is uncertain which (cl. ξς 29, 81; Ulpiae, ic),
apparently provided that, in the absence oi causae probatio, the
minor triginta annis manumissus should belong to the new class
which it introduced, namely, the Latini.

ξ 18. Alumnus denotas a slave child reared by th'e manumitter,
as appears from the following passage: Alumnoa magis mulieribus
conveniens est manumittere, sed et in viris receptum est, satisque
et permitti eum manumitti in quo nutriendo propensiorem animum
. iecerint, Dig. 40, 2, 14 pr. ‘Foster children are more naturally
’ manumittcd by women than hymen, though not exclusively3 and
it suflices to allow the manumission of a child who has won his
maater's affection iu the course oi hie education' (ror the custom
derived from Greece ol employing elavos ae paedagogi in Roman
houaebclds see Smith's Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiq. s. v.)

t 20. The Equites Romani, who at Rome composed a moiety
oi tbe council mentioned in the text, were either Equites or Equites
equo publico (for the title eques Romanus equopublico, which appears
in insaeptum, ses Wilmann’s Index Inscriptionum, 2178, 2182 3 cl.
