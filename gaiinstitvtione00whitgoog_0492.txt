’11111 following observatione horrowed from Ihering are supple·
mentory tc the statements on the nature 01 1011101, contracts

The contracte which in this 11001100 have been designated as
rosumere sometimes 11011 0 different point of view called 10011101,
and an examination of the meaning 01 this 10111 may throw light
on the 11101101 101 which Formal contracte were invented by juris·
prudence and which this term expresses 'Phe explanation 01 the
term turns on two conceptione: the Gsuse 0101 obligation (causa
obligationis) and the Form 010 Disposition: the cause alone necds
elucidation.

A unilateral contenet, consisting merely of 0 promise by one
party and 01 acceptancc by another, is the result of a decomposition
0101 actual 1101000110101 0011110100 and 111οε actual 110100011010
010 always (10 00100110 101 the present the caso 01 1101011011
bilatercl. The unilsteral agreement, conforring a benefit on A and
imposing 0 burden on Β, 10 always accompanicd by another uni·
1010101 disposition burdensomc to A and beneficial 10 Β. The two
unilateral dispositions ere reciprocclly cause and effect: when one
10 regarded 'ss the causal 100101, the other must be regarded (11 we
maycoin a term) 00 the sequent or dependent 100101 011110 composite
or bilateral transaction.

Thus Mutuum, ifwe take ons factor, is the promise to pay a sum
1011011 the promieor 1100 received from 110 promisee: 11 we take the
other factor, it is the 0110101101 01 property to a person eobo promises
