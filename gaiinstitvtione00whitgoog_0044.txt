xxxviii HISTORIGAL INTRODUOTION

and the men who held this office still furniehed for centurias the
leading names to Roman jurisprudence. At first the soience was
imparted withan air ol mystery; the advice was occasional and
elicited only by special request. But finally the profession oi law
on the part of the Pontiffs became more open and more systematic.
The first of these who taught the science publicly is said to have
been Tiberine Coruncanius ² (circo 280 no), who was also the first
plebeian Pontifex Maximus. Lastly, the stage of written eom·
mentnries was reached. These commentarios were stimulated by
the increasing difficulty of interpreting the language and meaning
of the Twelve Tables. The earliest commentator on this code who
is known to us, was Sextus Aelius Paetus, consul in 198 and censor
in 193 no. He busied himself with the interpretation of the legal
difficulties connected with the Tables, and published awork called
Tra'pertc'to, which gave in three divisione the text of the Tables, an
explanation of each ordinance, and the form ol action applicable to
the cases which these ordinances raised ². His later contemporary,
Acilius, seems also to have been a legal commentator ³. An ex·
planation of the obsoleto language ol the Tables was, so far as we
know, first attempted by the great philologist Lucius Aelius Stilo
Praeconinus, who was bom about 154 no* One of the results of
the work of these commentatore was that the text ol the Tables, as
it appeared in their editions, became the recognized, and in fact the
only, text for all subsequent ages3 for it seems quite clear that the
later commentatore, as for instance Gaius, had no knowledge ol any
antique copy of the Tables, engraved on metal and posted up in
some public placet But there was another-reason whyaknowledge ¹
of the Tables, in their original form, was becoming decedent even
during the period of the later Republic The Praetor's Edict, as
aliving source of law, was superseding the ancient Oode. J uristio
investigation was grappling with present problems and did not care
to concern itseli with the antique. The Tables had been explained ;
now they were to be expanded. But the expansion came with the
edict, and with the ereative jurisprudence which was a product of

the new Greek culture and the extensior of the Roman Empire.
The founders of this scientific jurisprudence, whose labours were to
be perpetuated by the lawyers of the Principate, were Marcus J unius
Brutus, Marcus⁶ Manilius and Publius Mucius Scaevola all ol whom
