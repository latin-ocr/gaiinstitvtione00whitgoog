cassio amorius, ie. an assignment oi actions between the agent
and prineipul, or the agent and the other party to the eontraot.

But in process of time, the manager of a shop (institor) and captain
of a ship (magister) were enabled by praetorian law to melre the
employer and shipowner (exercitor) liable to third parties by means
of the actions institoria and exercitoria, who could sue the principal,
4 ξ 71. This was gradually extended eo aa to allow to all persons
who eontraeted with an agent having authority for the purpose a
right of aetion, called quasi institoria, against his employer, as well
aa against the agent himself, who was the eontraoting party.

When the praetore, prooeeding by timid and hesitating steps, had
reaohed this point, the Roman law ol agenoy had nearly approaohed
the system we find established in modern Europe. Under this
system it is a general rule, that when an agent is duly eonstituted
and disoloses the name of his principal, so as to enable the party
with whom he deals to have reoourse to the principal, and eontraets
in his name and on his behalf, and does not exoeed his authority,
the prineipal is responsible and not the agent But in Roman law
the fres agent is never regarded simply aa an instrument for bringing
about an agreement between the parties interested, unless he is
a mere nuntius If he makes a eontraot for his prinoipal he eannot
eeoape being a party to it and so being liable under it; though by
means of an aetio adjecticiae qualitatis, the prinoipal may also be
rendered liable. See above, ξ 103 and 4 ξ ³4.

After explaining obligations founded on eontraot, J ustinian, Inst
3, 27, treats of a miscellaneous group of obligations whioh are neither
founded on eontraot nor on delict, but w-hioh, as the oiroumstanoes
in which they ariae and their effeot resemble more or less the eircum-
stanoes and effeot of one or other of the legal eontraets, are denomi-
nated by the name of obligations quasi ex eontraotu. These demand
from us a brief notice.

Three of them, namely, those which ground the actions by or
against a tutor, by or against a ourator, by or against an unau-
thorized agent (negotiorum gestor), olearly resemble obligations
founded on the eontraot of mandate. The ward and minor stand
to the tutor and curator nearly in the relation oi prinoipal and
agent, although they are legally inoompetent to give an authority
(mandatnm) or eonfer a power of administration. A person who,
in the absenoe and without the authority of another, voluntarily inter·
· iered to proteot his interests (voluntarius procurator) incurred liability
and aequired rights against the person in whose affairs he interfered.
English law does not recognize a title to compensation in the ease
of voluntary interferenoe, unless we find a parallel in the rights of
salvors in the osse of property lost or endangered on the ooean.
