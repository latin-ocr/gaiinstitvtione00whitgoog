to all judicati, the lex Poetelia abolished it ior nexum, Bethmann·
Hollweg, Rem. Civ. Prae. 5112.

The assignment(addictio) of the insolvent horrower reduced him
to a state oi partial servitude. But the Roman lawyers distinguished
between partial slavery (servire) and complete slavery (servum esse),
Quintilian, 7, 3. For instance, the addictus retained his praenomen,
nomen, cognomen, tribe, could by payment oi his debt recover his ¹

liberty at any time without the consent oi the creditor, and on
recovery oi his liberty was not libertinus but ingenuus As, then,
addictio did not reduce a ireeman to· slavery, it did not operate
a degradation oi status (capitis minutio).

insolvenoy, however, deeply affected another branchos status,
namely, civitas, although even here, as it only partially destroyed
the privileges oi civitas, it was not considered to operate a capitis
miputio. Civitas, as we have seen, consisted oi two portione,
certain politioal or public rights, jus suffragii and jus honorum, and
certain civil or private rights, collectively denominated commercium
and connubium. The political hali oi civitas was destroyed by
insolvenoy, which deprived a man of his electoral powers and his
capacity for office, and reduced him to the condition oi aerarius;
and even the civil hali was seriously impaired, and principally in
respect of commercium. Of the aggregate oi capacities called
commercium the privilege forieited by insolvenoy was the capacity
oi appointing or being appointed procurator, Inst. 4, 13, 11. By
being disabled from appointing a procurator a man might be
seriously hampered in his commercial proceedings, as he would
be unable to cede a right of action; by being disqualified ior acting
as procurator he would be unable to acquire by cesdon a right of
action, and would be unable to sue for a penalty as an informer in
a popularis actio, 4 t 82, comm, for the prosecutor in such an action
was considered to betha procurator ofthe people. The various ,
privileges enjoyed by a citizen of untarniahed credit, and liable to
be forieited by insolvenoy or otherwise, were called his existimatio,
and the disabilities attaching to loss of existimatio were summed up
in the word ‘infamia' or ‘ ignominia'

The early Civil law allowed, as we have seen, the body of the
insolvent debtor to be pursued, but provided no direct process
against his property. This want, which would be the more felt as ,
Roman commarca extended, was at length supplied by the Praetor.

In close imitation oi this execution against the body, a process
oi execution against the property of an insolvent was introduced
by a praetor named Publius Rutilius, about a century before the
Christian era, 4 ξ 35. It may be assumed from the parallelism of
these proceedings that the interval oi thirty days which was required
