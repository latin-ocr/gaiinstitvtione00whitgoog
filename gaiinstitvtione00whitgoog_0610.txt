Exception had sometimes a stronger, sometimes a wealrer, opera·
tion: the stronger effect is the extinction oi both civilis and
naturalis obligatio. Such is the effect of the exceptio Sc. Vellaesni,

that it huot a ground te support an action may have other important
consequences: it excludes indebiti condictio in the event oi payment
by mistero, and it may be a ground to support compensatio, novatio,

or Exceptio temporalis had the wealrer or the stronger operation.

We must distinguish between Real and Personal actions.

'Phe effect of the mere limitation of a real action (e. g. vindicatio)
is that the right oi the original owner continues, bnt is not
ground to support an action against the possessor or his successor.
' If the thing pasees into the possession of a etr-anger, then the
original owner can recover it from him by vindicatio: and ifit
comes by lawful means into the possession ot the original owner,
the former possessor cannot recover it from him by vindicatio,
cod. 7, 39, 8, 1. In the event of bona fides there could under
the law oi Justinian aiter thir-ty cr ferty years be no question
ol mere limitation; because then, as we have seem the very jus cf
the original owner would have been ertingrrished. In real actions,
then, limitaticn does not entirely deprive the owner of his right,
though here of course there is no obligatio naturalis.

The effect of prescripticn or limitation in personal actions is contro·
verted. Savigny holds that the stronger effectis confined to ex·
ceptione founded cnjusnaturale; and that prescription being, as shown
by its arbitrary numerical character, an institution of jus civile, can
only have the weaker operation, i. e. leaves untouched the obligsh'o
naturalis, §249. Vangerow, however, seems to show conclusively,
ξ 151, that this doctrine is not tenable. Many passages cf the
Digest show that in temporal actions prescription of right to sne
had the stronger operation, excluding fidejussio, Dig. 46, l, 37, and
constitutum, Dig. 13, 5, 18, 1, that is not regarding a prescribed
debt as a subsisting debt for the purpose oi being secured by way of
