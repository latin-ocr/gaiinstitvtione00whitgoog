xl HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION

Controversy grew aud flourished ¹. rho only prooi of the validity

of an opinion was its acceptance by a court. But even this was but
a slender proci ; for different Praetors or J udices might be under the
sway of different jurists. It required a single superior court and a
single controlling authority (both of which were found in the Princi-
pate) to guido the stream of legal opinion into narrower and more
certain channela

Amidst this stream of interpretation we discern one attempt to
give a fixity to at least a part of Roman law. Ofilius, a Roman
knight of the period of Cicero and Caesar, was the first to reduce
the Praetors Edict to some kind of system ². It is probable that
a still greater work ot revision was at one time projected for this
jurist; for we are told that Caesar, amidst his ambitione schemas
for the regeneration of the Roman world, conceived the idea of
making a digest of the Roman law³. Had he lived to carry out
this scheme, it is probable that Ofilius would have been outrusted
with the work.

§lh Refoama to Proccdarc affected dwiop tte kiter period
of tte Reptcbltc.

The progness effected during this period in the theory of law was
accompanied bya great reform in procedure. From about 150 a. c.
the process both of the civil and criminal courts began to assume
a form which was final for the period of the Republic, and which
was supplemented, but not altered, during the greater part of the
period of the Principate ⁴. In the domuin of Oivil Procedure, a Lex
Aebutia gave some kind of formal sanction to the practice by which
the Praetor tended to substitute the simpler Formula for the more
complex Logia Actio ⁸. rhe Formula had perhaps first been employed
in the statement of casos for Peregrini. Its utility commended its
use for cases in which Roman citizens alone were involved. The
Praetor Urbanus employed it for his honorary jurisdiction ; it was
then transferred (doubtless by the Lex Aebutia) to the civil law es
an alternative, in most cases, to the Legis Actio. We cannot say in
