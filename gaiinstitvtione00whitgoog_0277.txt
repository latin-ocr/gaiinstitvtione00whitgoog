(3) Or it may consist in the absence of the praetor from the court.
Such absence might be occidental, or it might arise from the regular
intermission of the dies juridici, or days on which the praetor per·
formed his judicial functione, ξ 279, comm. As in thetime of Marcus
Aurelius such days only amounted to 2³0 in a year (Suetonius,
meviam, 32), thie causa alone would make annus utilis equivalent
to aboutllordinary years. The intermission of diesjuridici was doubt-
less the principal cause ol a olaimant’s inability to perform an act in
court on certain days; but in Roman law, asin modern times it was ad·
ministered in Germauy, when much of the procedure in an action had

, come to consistin delivery of writings at the office of a court, irrespec·

f tively of its session days and vacatione, this cause lost its importance.
ζ Knowledge (scientia) of the fact that he is entitled is not neces·
ἵ sarlly requisito on the part of the person entitled: in other words,
¹ his ignorance is not always sufficient to exclude a day from the
’ number of dies utiles The prescription of an action, when itis

, accomplished in annus utilis, begins to run from its nativity (actio
’ nata), irrespectively of the plaintift's knowledge of his right to sue.

Ignorance of a right of action is generally the effect oi Negligence,
and therefore undeserying of relies, and might be protracted for
an indefinite period, On the contrary, ignorance is sometimes
a condition that delays the commencement of tempus continuum:
for instance, the 50 dies continui allowed to a person for stating
the grounds on which he was entitled to be excused from accepting
a guardianship only began to run when he had notice oi his nomina·

Ἴ tion, Inst 1, 25, 162 which shows that scientia and ignorantia have

no necessary relation to the distinction of dies utiles and dies continui.

Iu the demand (agnitio) othonorum possessio, however, by the
claimant of a testate or intestato successim, the edict expressly made
the scientia as well as the potestas of the claimant acondition of dies
utilis, Dig. 38, 15, 2. Indeed theoditio ofan inheritance was not
possible unless made with a knowledge of the fact of the delatio
and of its nature, whether testacy or intestacy. Moreover the igno·
rance of lais rights could not be ascribed to the negligence of the

η person entitled, nor was it likely to be indefinitely protracted, as it

would be the interest oi the person next entitled to give him notice

Ἴ of the deletion. Knowledge will generally only effect the beginning

ola term, aud the person who is once made aware of the delatiou of

Ῠ an inheritance will usually continue aware: but it is possible that

a period of error should supervene; for instance, that, after an Ἴ
agnato has notice that he is entitled by intestacy and after his term
lor acceptance has commenced to run, a forged will should be produced
and obtain credit: in which case the dies utiles would not continue to

run until the forgery of the will was ascemained. savigny, ξ 189.
