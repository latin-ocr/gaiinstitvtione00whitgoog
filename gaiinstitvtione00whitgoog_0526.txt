of such attestation (i. e if the defendant avoid service by keeping
out of the way) the plaintiff on three marketdays shall stand before
the defendant’s door and wawl (loudly summon him to appear (‘?), and
after this the defendant shall be liable to manus injectio).' Compare
the Hindoo custom of ‘sitting dharira’ i. e. fasting at the door of a
dcbtor. See Maine's Early History of Institutione, pp. 40, 297-29e

(2) Manus injectio ceased to be a mere act of legalined aelf-reduess,
and became the part oia statute-process (legis actio) whenever it took
place before the magistrate, either a Vindex interposing, or, in manus
injectio pura, in case of tho alleged debtor becoming himself and not
by means of evindex defendant in ajudicium for determining whether
he was liable to the process, lheriug, ll, e. 'I'he vindex (the word
is like vindicatio and vindiciae derived from vim dicare) was in
en analogous position to the assertor libertatis, since a person who
was himself the object of a suit could not himself be defendant in it
A debtor who was addicted to his creditor did not, however, thereby
lose either his freedom or his citizenship, though incapable while his
confinement lasted of exercising his rights. l

The right of a creditor to carry off his debtor under the award r
(addictio) of a magistrate, might either be founded on a previous
jndgmant against the dcbtor (judicatus), or be given by some spoeial
statute against other dcbtors who were treated as jndgmant dcbtors
(pro judicato). In both these cases the dcbtor could only defend
himself by a vindex. But in some cases where manus injectio came
to be allowed, as Gaius explains,§ 24, the process was made less
harsh, and the defendant was allowed to defend himself without
supplying a vindex (manus injectio pura). It is to be noticed that
Gaius does not refer to the case of the debtor bound in early law by
nexum and subject to manus injectio, cf. 3 §§ 88, 89.

§5 22-25. The lex Furia de sponsu (³ ξ 121), (as to the date of this
law and the question whether it is referred to by Cicero see Karlowa
Rom. Rechtsgesch. 2, 735, and Roby 2, 30, n. 2), limited the obligu-
tion of the sponsor and fidepromissor to two years, and divided it
equally among all the sponsores and fidepromissores without regard
to their solvency.

The word exegisset suggests that the lex Furia de sponsu was not
a lex perfecta ;—that the limitation of the sponsor’s liability to a pro·
portionate part of the principal debt was only affected by a penalty
being imposed on the creditor who exacted the whole obligation.

If we assume with Ihering that the lex Furia de sponsu and tho
lex Furia testamentaria (2 ξ 225) were separate clauses of the same
enactment, we can understand why manus injectio pro judicato,
which was expresely made the remedy in lex Furia dc sponsu, was
extended by interpretation to lex Furia testamentaria: although this
