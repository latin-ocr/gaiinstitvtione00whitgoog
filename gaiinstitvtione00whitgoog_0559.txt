'I'his arbitrium would not be rechoned among the forms of statute·
process because it was merely acoessory 10 the actio sacramenti or
principal action Bethmann-Hollweg, 187. Keller, O. P. § 16.

Two incidente 01 litis aestimatio in the formulary procedure
deserve notice: (1) Jusjurandum inlitam, and (2) the determination
01 the moment to be considered by the judex in appraising the
velue of the plaintiii's interest

(1) Jusjurandum in litem was not like jusjurandum necessarium

a substitute for a judgment, but only one of the means 01 proci
whereon in certain actions ajudgment might be founded. These
actions were (a) principally actiones arbitrariae, though they might be

also simply bonae fidei actiones. To induce the defendant to avoid
condemnation by obedience to the judge's arbitratus, if the defendant
contumaciously refused obedience, or by dolus or culpe lata had
rendered himself unable to yield obedience 10 the order of the judex,
the value of the plaintiff's interest in the subject of litigation (litis
aestimatio) was not ascertained, as in other cases, by the judex with
or without the aid 01 experts, but by the oath of the plaintiff.
Although he was required to name the true valae (quanti actoris
intersit), not a mere fancy value er so·called value of affection, yet
his conscientious estimate would naturally be higher than that 01 an
impartiat judge or disinterested valuer: and the largeness 01 the
alternative condemnation would incline the defendant to make a
specific restitution.

(b) Even in actiones striati juris and actiones ex delicto, if litis
aestimatio, owing to the eulpa 01 the defendant, is otherwise
impossible to the judex 3 11, 101· instance, in the aetio legis Aquiliae
the subject has ceased to exist, then the judex may employ the oath
01 the plaintiff asa subsidiary evidence of the plaintiffs particular
interest in the subject and of its market value. The actio injuriarum
given by the Praetoris specially called aestimatoria because damages
in it were assessed in this way, 35 224. Vangerow, § 171.

(a) ’1110 Date of valuation, or time at which 1110 value 01 1110
speciae ¹thing due from the defendant was estimated, depended on
the nature of the action. As ageneral rule the· date of valuation in
stricti juris actions was the date 01 Litis contestatio, in Bonae fidei
and Real actions the date 01 Condemnatio, Dig. 13, 6, 3, 2. But
if a date for performanoe had been fixed ina contraet that date was
thedate of valuation, Dig. 13, 3, 4. Again, iithe defendant had
been guilty of Mora, 2 §§ aso-289, comm, the plaintiff had his
election between any 01 these dates and the date of liora, Dig. 19,
l, 3, 3, Dig. 17, 1, 37. 'l‘he foregoing only relatas to Real actions
