§ 187. 'I'his rule was abolished by Justinian, who enscted thet
the enfranohisement of the testator's slave, though unexpressed,
should always be implied in hie institution as heir. Cod. 6, 27, 5;
Inst. l, 6, 2.

5188. Justinian explains why the slave lost his liberty: De·
stitisse enim a libertatis datione videtur dominus qui eum alienavit,
Inet. 2,14, 1. ‘A revocation of the bequest of liberty is inferred
from the fact ol his alienation.' If we ask why the implied inten-
tion that suffices tc revohe the enfranchisement does not suffice to
revohe the institution, the answer is, that a bequest can be revehed
by any act clearly implying an intention to revolso, whereas an insti·
tution requires a more solemn revocation, by execution of a later
will, or some other means, §5 147-151, comm.

5189. What was the motivo of instituting as heir the slave ol
mother person? Such a disposition could not be dictated by hindness
tc the slave, for he would probably gain nothing by his institution3
but was a device adopted for two purposes, (r) for facilitating the
conversion of a succession into money, and (ι) for securing an institu-
tion against lailure.

(1) By such a disposition the testator gave the proprietor of tho
slave, whose benefit was intended, the option of either becoming
aetrral heir, or of doing, what he could not otherwise readily do, i. e.
of receiving the net value, or a large portion of the net velue, of
the semion, without incurring the expense of the annexed sacred
ritas (mora) and the burden of administration, by practioally selling
the snccession for the highest price he could get to any one who was
willing to incur these expensas and troubles aa a matter of specula-
tion. '1¹0 effect thia, he had only to sell the slave ataprice enhanoed
