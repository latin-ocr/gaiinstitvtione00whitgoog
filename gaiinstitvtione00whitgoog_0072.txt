consult him Nor were legal opinions always given in a letter
closed and sealed, but were generally laid before the jndge in
the writing or· by the attestation of one ol the suitors. Augustus,
in order to increase their weight, enaoted that they should bo
clothed with his authority, and hencelorth this office was sought for
as a privilege? These jurists who bad the jus respondendi were
called juris auctores. Their auctoritas resided, in the first instance,
in their responsa, or the written opinions they gave when consulted
on a single case3 but in the second instance, doubtless, in their
writings (sententiae et maiores), which were mainly a compila-
tion of their responsa, a fact which has left its traces in the
disjointed and incoherent style which disagreeably characterizes
Roman juristic literature. The jus respondendi instituted by
Augustus and regulated by Tiberius, who themselves held the office
of Pontifex Maximus, gave those to whom it belonged similar
authority in interpreting law as hed previously been exercised by ¹
the College oi Pontifices-‘omnium tamen harum et interpretandi
scientia et actiones apud Collegium Pontificum erant, ex quibus
constituebatur, quis quoque anno praeesset privatis' (Pomponius in
Dig. 1, 2, 6 ; cf. Sohm, ξ 18).

As to the mode oi collecting the opinions oi the juris auctores
no precise information hes come down to us, but § 6 shows that the
duty of the judex, in the not unoommon event ol the authorities
differing in their opinions on a csse, was open to doubt, till Hadrian’s
rescript allowed him under these circumstances to adopt the opinion
he preferred. It may be gethered from the words ‘quorum omnium’
that all authorized jurists had to be consulted. The jus respondendi,
as thus explained, may have continued in existence till the end of
¹ the third century, by which time the originative force of Roman
jurisprudence had oeaeed. Instead of giving independent opinions
jurists had beeonm officials of the emperor, advising him in drawing
rescripte and other affairs oi imperial government. Legal authority
rested in the writings oi deceased iuris auctores. (For a discussion
ol the causes of the decline of Roman Jurisprudenoe see Grueber’s
Art. in Law Quarterly Review, vi'a 70.) In the course of centuriee
the accumulatior ot juristic writings ol coordinata authority was
a serious embarrassment to the tribunale. ‘l'o remedy this evil,
Α. n. 426, Valentinian III enaoted what is called the law of citatione,
cod. Theodosianus, l, 4, 3, limiting legal authority to the opinions
of five jurists, (laius, Papinian, Ulpisn, Paulus, Modestinus, and of
any other juriste whom these writers quoted, provided that such
quotations should be verified by reference to the original writings of
these jurists (codicum collatione firmentur-on the question of the
way ol interpreting these words cf. Sohm, p. 122, n. 1,§ 21). In case
