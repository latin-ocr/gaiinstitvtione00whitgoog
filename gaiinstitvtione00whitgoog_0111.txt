Affinity (affinitas) is the relationship of a person to the kin
(cognatesl os a spouse. The husband is allied to the kin of the wife,
the wife to the kin of the husband ; but there is no alliance between

t the kin ol the husband sud the kin oi the wife. The following am
some of the names given to these relationships In the ascending
line the father and mother of the wife cr husband are socer and
socrus (father-inlaw, mother-in-law), and in relation to them the
husband cf the daughter and wife of theson are gener and nurus
(scu-inlaw, daughter-in-law). In tho descending line the children
oi the spouse are privignus aud privigna (step-son, step-daughter),
md in relation to them the husband of the mother and the wile oi
the father are vitricus and noverca (stepfather and stepmother).
lu tho collateral line the husband's brother is levir (brother-inlaw),
the husband's sister is glos (sister-indaw). Intermanisge with affines
inths direct line, cr their ascendente or descendants, was absolutely
prohibited; collateral allisnce appears to have been no impediment
inthe time of Gaius, but at a later period marriage with a deceased
brothers wife or a deceased wife's sister was forbidden, Ood. Thecd.
