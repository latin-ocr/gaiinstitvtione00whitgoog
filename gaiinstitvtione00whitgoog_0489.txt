branch of the Privato code to the Criminal code; that is, are not
punished at the discretiones a private plaintiff, but by the action of
a public prosecutor. Savigny, Law of Obligation, ξ 84.

Gaius seems to have been misled by a double meaning of Injuria
when he connects the actio Iniuriarum with the redress given by
the Twelve Tables for grievous bodily harm, ξ 223. There seems to
be no necessary connexion between bodily harm and dishonour,
although both may have been denoted in Latin by the word Injuria

In actions on Delict more especially, Real actions differing in this
respect from the liability of a defendant necessarily implies that he
is convicted either of Dolus or of culpa, unlawful intention or un·
lawful negligence, § 211.

The opposite of Negligence is Diligence, vigilance, attention,
which, like Negligence, admits of an infinite variety of gradatione

Actione under the lex Aquilia, instituted to recover ior nnlawful
damage, are subject to this rule that, when Culpa, that is absence
of ordinary care, is once established, the amount of the defendant's
liability does not depend on its degree.

In actions founded on Dispositions, that is on Contract and quasi·
contract, the liability of the defendant may depend on the degree
of his negligence. In most relations a man is bound to make good
losses occasioned by slight negligence (culpa levis in abstracto), that
is, is liable for lack of ordinary care or care taken by an average
paterfamilias; in others he isjudged bya somewhat lower standard,
being only bound to take the same care of the property of another
as he is accustomed to take of his own (culpa levis in concretolt in
others again he is only made answerable for the consequences of
gross negligence, culpa lata.

The terme, Gross and Slight, like other quantitative terme, have
no positive signification until we fix upon some unit of measure·
ment or standard of comparison to which any given instance may
be referred and by which it may be measured. Two standands are
frequently employed by the Roman juriste: the vigilant care (exacta
diligentia) of a good man of business (diligens paterfamilias, homo
frugi) and the care which a given individnal habitually bestows cn
his own interests (suus modus, diligentia quam suis rebus adhibere
solet). Slight negligence is the absence of the diligence of the
careful man of business; gross negligence falls considerably below
this standard Diligence and negligence, when referred to the
standard oi the carelul man of business, are sometimes called
abstract or absolute; when referred to the habitusl conduct of
the individual in the management of his own affairs, concrete or
relative
