F ORMAL ALIENATION 435

about which we know eo little) resembled Stipulatio in containing no
such recognition.

Ihering, who has handled thie topic, ξ 55, appliee the term assraat'r
to Formal alienatione When, however, we compare Formal and

Formleee alienatione we find the terme Abstraot and Concreto not eo
applicable to alienatione ae they were to contracte, and for this
reason: in Formleee alienation there ie aa complete an asernacrrou
or severanus of the sequent from tho causal factor aethere isin
Formal; and 'Proditionis aa unilateral a transaction ae Mancipation
or Surrender before a magistrate.

This assertion may esem inconsistent with tha doctrine (2 ξ 65,
comm.) that, to constitutos valid alienation‚ 'tradition must bs
preceded by some jueta causa, Donatio, Contractus, or Solutio. The
preceding disposition, however, ie not required in order to form the
caueal factor of abilateral disposition, but in order to furnieh evidence
of the Intention required for a unilateral disposition: to prove the
existence of animus transferendi dominii, without which Tradition
would be a Form without a substance, would want the intemsl
clement it requiras in order to amount to a Disposition. Once let
the sequent iactor, the intention requisito for a unilateral disposition,
be proved, and the justa cama, the donandi, credendi, solvendi
animus ie immaterial. Thus a misunderstanding between alienor
and alienae respecting the nature ol the transaction, the one intend·
ing a loan the ethera donation, or the one intending the discharge
of a debt imposed by testament the other the discharge oi a debt
imposed by stipulation, ie immaterial: besam the intention oi dona·
tion and of loan, of paying a legacy and of paying a stipulated debt,
aliha involve the animue trmsferendi dominii. Cum in corpus
quidem quod traditur consentiamus in oaueie vero dissentiamus, non
animadverto cur inefficax eit traditio, veluti ei ego modam me ex
testamento tibi obligatum esse, ut fundum tradam, tu existimes ex
stipulatu tibi eum deberi Nam et si pecuniam numeratam tibi
tradam donandi gratia, tusam quasi creditam accipias, constat pro-
prietatem ad te transire nec impedimento esse, quod circa causam
dandi atque accipiendi dissenserimus, Julian, Dig. 41, 1, 36. An
error in respect oi the eausa may bo sufficient to entitls an alienor
to condictio indebiti or condictio eine causa 3 ie. to a suit for
restitution for want oi consideration: but it does not prevent the
transfer of ownerehip in the first instance: and if the property
pasees onward to a third person the alienor cannot reaoh it in hie
hande, but has only a persona] action against the original alienae

In one particular instance, by special statutory enactment, the
carrea traditionis is material to the efficaoy of Tradition. Tradition
