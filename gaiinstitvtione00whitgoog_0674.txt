’ἴσαι of the cases we haye mentioned, the possession of the
emphyteuta, tho mortgagee‚ the sequestrator, and the permissive
holder, are generally regarded as anomalous; for possession is oom-
posed of two clemente, physioal detention and the intention of holding
the property as owner (animus domini), and none of these four
possessore can be said to have the animus domini. In these four
cases, and these alone, it is necessary to assume that the law
recognized a derivative or transferred possession, in which one of
the elementa of original possession, the animus domini, is absent, and
replaced by what may be ¹called the animus alienam possessionem exer·
cendi. (Foradifferentviewofthoanimusrequiredasanelementoipos

In three of the above-mentioned cases usucapionpossession re
mained with the person from whom the interdici-possession was
derived (the person from whom the emphyteusis was held, tho
mortgagor or pledgor, the person who allowed the thing to be hold
precariouely), and only interdici-possession passed to the derivative
possessor (the emphyteuta, the mortgagee or pledgee, the person
allowed to hold the thing precariously). In all the four ceses (in-
cluding Sequestration) the dominus lost the protection of the inter·
dicte Retinendae possessionis, which were transferred to the derivative
possessors 'Phe grauior of precarious tenancy was also protected
by the interdict De precario, an interdict Recuperandae possessionis

The Superficiarius (holder of a Reul right (jus in re) in a house
of which the owner of the ground is proprietor, e. g. a person who
with permission of the landowner has built out of his own materiale
a house on and therefore belonging to another person's land, ‘quod
inaedificatur solo solo cedit') has, according to Savigny, only juris
quasi-possessio: but this is inconsistent with the fact that hoie
protected by the interdicte Unde vi and De precario, Dig. 43, 16, l,5.
According to Vangerow he has Derivative possession like the four
above-mentioned: but this is inconsistent with the fact that- hoie
protected by the special interdict De superficiebus, while the owner
of the soil retains the protection oi Uti possidetis, Dig. 43, 17, ³, i,
which in Derivative possession is transferred to the Derivative poe
sessor. The true doctrine, then, appears to be that superficiatus
has Originel possession of the house, though the lundlord has pos
session of the soil, Baron, t 183 (but cf. on this very difficult subject
Windscheid‚ l §154,n. 7). superficies as a real right would be
vindicated by a special formula in factum concepta, which must be
distinguished from the possessory remedy-the interdictum de super·
