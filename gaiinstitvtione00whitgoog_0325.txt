sacrificia) being exempted from litigation. Besides these occasional ,
interruptione of litigation, there were longer set vacatione, which
we find rearranged on several occasions. Thus at one time we find
two judicial terms (rerum actus, cum res aguntur) in the year, a
winter and a summer term, and two vacatione, one in spring and
another in autumn. Claudius substituted a single vacation at the
close of tho year, and made the law term continuous. Rerum actum,
divisum antea in hibernos aestivosque menses, conjunxit, Suetonius,
Claudius, 23. Galba abolished this vacation, and confined the
intervals oi litigation to dies feriati. Marcus Aurelius, in the tim'e
of Gaius, abolished the distinction between the jurisdiction term
(dies fasti) and the trial term (rerum actus). He devoted two hun·
dred and thirty days (adding the number oi dies fasti· to the number
of dies comitiales) to forensia proceedings, under the name ol dies

* juridici or dies judiciarii, and allowed even the rest of the year, dies

feriati, to be used for litigation with the consent of the parties.
Judiciariae rei singularem diligentiam adhibuit: fastis dies judicia-
rios addidit, ita ut ducentos triginta dies annuos rebus agendis
litibusque disceptandis constitueret, Capitolinus, Marcus,10. ‘He
also very carefully regulated the administratiou of justice, adding
forensia days to the calendar, and allotting two hundred and thirty
to litigation and civil suits!

Subsequently to the time of Gaius, a law of Valentinian, Theo-
dosius, and Arcadius, A. n. 389, while it declared the principle that
all days are dies juridici, exceptcd, besides Sundays aud certain
other bolidays, two months for harvest and vintage, aud two weslrs

³ at Easter. Justinian further appointed, by way ol interpolation in

thia law, certain vacatious at Christrnas, Epiphany, and Pentecost,
Cod. 3, 12, 6, thus furnishing the model on which the four English

³ law terma were regulated by Edward the confessor. Subsequently
ἶ the Statute oi Westminster, 13 Edward Ι, permitted assises to

be held in the vacatione, and thus a distinction grew up in England

. somewhat resembling thatof the jurisdictional (dies fasti) and judicial Ι
terms (rerum achis); with this difference, however, that the same
= judges presided both in their own court held at Westminster, and on

l aaeize, where they acted under commissions to try casea in thc county
ῐ in which thecause of action arose. Thus in Englanda judge, after

sitting at Westminster during term, was able to go on circuit during
part oi the vacatiori ς but at Rome the distinction rested on the

l difference between proceedings injure and injudicio. See Puchta,
