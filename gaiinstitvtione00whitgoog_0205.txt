528. So incorporeal hereditaments ln English law were said to
lie in grant, not in feoffment, i. e. ιο be only conveyable by dead, or
writing under scsl; whereas corporeal hereditaments were convey·
able by feoffment, ia. by livery of seisin or delivery of possession.

5 30. Inalienability was no peculiar characteristic of Uaufruct and
other personal servitudes. Alienation of rights, or singular succes·

= sion as opposed to inheritance or universal succession, was the excep·

tion, nottho rule. Dominion over res singulae was alienabis, but
almost all other rights were intransicrable. If we except the case oi
hereditas legitima delata 5 ³5, hereditas, aa we shall ses, was inalien-
sble: and whatisaaid of Urban and Rural praedial servitudes,55 29, 30,
refers to their creation, not to their alienation. In the law of Per·
sons, Patria potestas, l 5 134, and Tutela in some cases, 1 5 168,
could be transferred but only by surrender before a magistrate (in
jure cessio), 'aa a process which feignsd that there was no transfer.
lienus and mancipium could be extinguished but not transferred
[Iber-ing, 5 32], except that, apparently, mancipium could be retrans-
ferred ιο the natural parent or mancipator, 1 5 132.

5 31. It appears that convention (pactio et stipulatio) alone un·
accompanied by tradition or quasi-tradition was capable of creating
a right analogous to a Roman servitude in provincial land, to which
injure cessio and mancipatio were inapplicable, in opposition to the
principle of Roman law, as stated by some modern writers, that mere
agreemem can only create at the utmost an obligation (jue in perso·
nam), and in order to create ajus in rem must be accompanicd by de,
livery of possession. But in our authorities this principleis confined
to rea corporales, which alone admit of real tradition. Exceptional
instances in which agreement without any further accompauiment
