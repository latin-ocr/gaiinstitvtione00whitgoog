whether its dispositione have any common character aa contrasted
vith the dispositione of the lsw of Things The law of Persona,
in other words, the law of Status, classilies men as slaves and free,
as citizens (privileged) and aliens (unprivileged), as paterfamilias

, (superior) and filiusfamilias (dependent). The law of Things looks

,¹ at men as plsying the parts ot contractors or of neighbouring
proprietors; in other words, the law of Persona considers men as
UNEQUALS, the lsw ol Things considers them as EQUALS: the
one may be defined as the law of relations of inequality, the other ss
the law of relations of equality.

It may induce us to believe that the law oi unequal relations
and the law of equal relations is s fundamental division of the
general code, if we consider how essential are the ideas ot equality
sud inequality to the fundamental conception of law. Π we ventured
on a Platonis myth, we might say that Zeus, wishing to confer the
greatest possible gift on the human race, took the most opposite
and uncombinable things in the universe, Equality and Inequality,
and, welding them together indissolubly, called the product by the
name of political society or positive law.

The assumption will hardly be controverted‚ that in the relations
of subject to subject, Positive law,·like Ethical law, recognizes, as
an ideal at least, the identity of the just (lawful) with the equal.
inequality, however, is no less essentiolly involved in positive law.
We have seen that there is no right and no duty by positive law
without a legislator and sovereign to whom the person owing the
duty is in subjectior. On the one side weaknsss, on the other
bresistible power. Positive rights and dutiae, then, imply both
the relation of subject to subject and the relation of subject to
sovereign or wielder of the sanction, in other words, both the relation
of equal to equal and the relation of unequsl to uaequal. It is the
more surprising that Austin should apparently have failed to seiae
with pmcision this conception oi the law of Persona, as he makes

the remark, in which the whole truth seems implicitly contained,
ξ that the bulk of the law of Persona composes the Public, Political,
or Constitutionsl code (jus publicumt Political society or govern-
ment essentially implies subordination. It implies, on the one hand,
sovereign power reposing in various legislative bodies, distributed,
delegsted, and vested in various corporations, magistrates, judges,
and other functionaries3 on the other hand, private persons or
subjecte subordinate to the sovereign power and to its delegatas and

ef subordination, so many relations oi superior and inferior, that is,
ao many relations of unaquals Public law, then, is a law of Status,
