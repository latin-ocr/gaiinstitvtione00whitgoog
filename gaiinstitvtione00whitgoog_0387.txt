The effect of Pignus was to put the debtor in a much more satis·
factory position than in the previous case; but on the other hand the
security oi the creditor was thereby rendered thus weaker, since he
was deprived of his actio in rem to recover the thing from third
parties, having only a posseseory interdict Nor apart from special
agreement (pactum de vendendo) had he any right oi sale.

(3) The law of pledge was established on a satisfactory footing,
when the praetor gave the creditor or pledgee the actio quasi-Serviane
in rem or hypothecaria, by which he acquired a real right in the
thing (jus in re aliena), while the debtor remained owner of it; a
right of sale, in case of delault being implied in the transaction. By
these changes both the interests of the debtor and creditor were fully
regarded. Under this system there was the further advantage, that
property of any kind might be given as security to a creditor by
Hypothecation, ie. by mere agreement without delivery of posses·
sion In this case it was simply the creation of a jus inre, imposing
no Obligation on the creditor thus secured. If, however, a pignus
was created by delivery of the thing pledged, the legal position oi the
pledgee would be oi a twoiold kind: (ι) he would have a jus inre
aliena, which he could enforce byactio quasiservianc in rem; (a) there
wouldbeacontractual relation betweenhim and the debtor, they being
bound to one another by the real eontract of pignus, which was
enforoed by the actio pignoraticia directa and contraria in personam.

The action cf the creditor to recover the thing pledged, called
quasisServiana, hypothecaria, or pignoraticia, was as we have seen
arecl action (in rem). It was originally, as actio Serviane, only given
to a former (colonus), whose invecta et illata were hypothecated tc
his landlord for rent. It was probably an actio arbitraria with a
formula infactum concepta (these terme will be explained in 4 ξ 47,
comm) to something like the following effect: Si paret inter
Aulum Agerium et L. litium convenissent ea res, quade agitur,
Aulo Agerio pignori hypothecaeve esset propter pecuniam debitam,
eamque rem tunc cum conveniebat, in bonis L, 'litii fuisse eamque
pecuniam neque solutam neque eo nomine satisfactum esse, neque per
Aulum Agerium stare quominus solvatur, nisi ea res arbitratu tuo
restituetur, quanti ea res mittentem pecuniam judex Numerium
Negerium Aulo Agerio condemna, dac, hanel, 5267.

Besides this actio Hypotheoaria, whereby the rights of the
mortgagee were definitively decided, there was an Interdictum
Saluianum, 4 t 147, to enable the landlord to recover the goods of
the iarmer pledged to him for his rent It is most probable that
this remedy was not like the actio Serviane, which was of later
origin, maintainable against third parties in possession of the goods.
Its formula was probably something like the following: ‘u euch
