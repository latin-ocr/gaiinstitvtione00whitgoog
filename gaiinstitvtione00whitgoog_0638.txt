Bona fides implies the absence of dolus: so far then as the
exceptio merely empowered the judex to take into consideration
equitable grounds of defense, no exceptio doli was necessary in
actions bonae fidei, for here the commission ol the judex expresrdy
authorized him in the intentio of the formula to decide upon equitable
grounds (ex bona fidel: Judicium fidei bonae est et continet in se
doli muli exceptionem, Dig. 30, 84, 5: Cum enim doli exceptio insit
de dote actioni, utin esteris bonae fidei judiciis, Dig. 24, 3, 21.
This, however, does not apply to the exceptio mi in judicium
deductae or rei judicatae and others like exceptio cognitor-ia and litis
dividuae, which are founded rather on special consideratione thau
on those relating to bona fides, and had to be expressed in the
formula, if they formed the defence of the defendant, even in
actions bonae fidei. (Of. Keller, Civil Process, ,t 35.)

Cicero gives the form of exceptio doli contained in the edictum
Asiaticum of Q. Mucius: Extra quam si ita negotium gestum eet ut
eo stari non oporteat ex fids bona, Ad Att 6, 1, ‘unless ths circum·
stances of the disposition make its enforcement inconsistent with the
principles of good faith' This seems to be impersonally named, but
the formula, as stated, may be incomplete. (cf. Dig. 44, 4, 2, 1.)

The exceptio doli from the comprehensiveness of its meaning.
does not sufficiently disclose the line of defence which a defendant
intends to pursue: accordingly, in Germany, the fact which mn·
stitutes the dolus is always required to be specified.

Property became litigious (res litigiosa) as soon ns it was the
subject of litis contestatio. Originally it was only on the side ol
the plaintiff (non-possessor) that alienation was prohibited, cf. t 117 a
· An edict ol Augustus prohibited the alienation of litigated Italic
land in terme which perhaps suggest the reason why an exceptio
was necessary in order to repel the claims of the alienee. Qui
contra edictum divi Augusti rem litigiosam a non possidente com·
paravit, praeterquam quod emptio nullius momenti est, poenam
quinquaginta sestertiorum fisco repraesentare compellitur: res autem
litigiosa videtur, de qua apud suum judicem lis delata est: sed hoc
in provincialibus fundis prava usurpatione optinuit. Fhagmentum
Ulpiani, de jure fisci, §8. ‘If, in contravention of the edict
of Augustus, an object of litigation is purchased of a vendor not
Ἴ in possession, the sale is notonly void but the purchaser forfeits
fifty sestertia to the treasury. Α thing seems to be en object ol
litigation, if an action concerning it has been submitted to a judea
This law has, however, been improperly applied to lands in the
provinces! Italic soil was aliened by mancipatio, 2 ξ 27; sud
mancipation of land transferred ownership in the property without
delivery ol possession. The edict only declarod the conhact of sale
