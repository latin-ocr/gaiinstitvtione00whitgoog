the proprietor and vested in another person. Servitudes are explained
by J ustinian in the parallel passage of his Institutas (2, 3-5), and,
together with the other jura in re aliena, demand here a briei notice.

Servitudes are (ι) praedisl or real (praediorum), that is, belong to
a person aa owner of a certain house or land (praedium dominam)
in respect oia house or land belonging to another propristor (prae-
dium serviens), or (a) personal (personarum), that is, are vested in
a person without relation to his ownership of praedium dominans,
and being thus inseparably attached to him they are inalienable and
determine at his death. (Compare in English law the division of ease·
ments into easements oppurtenant to land and aasements in gross.)

Praedial servitudee are servitudes in the striotest sense, being oon·

(A) oertain powers of aetion (jus utendi), and (Β) oertain powers of
exolusion (jus prohibendi). Restriotions on these powers will be
(a) a certain necessitas non utendi, and (t) a oertaiu necessitas
patiendi. Oormlative to these dutiae on the part ol the owner
of the servient tenement will be oertaiu rights of the owner of the
dominant tenement, viz. (α) a oertsin jus prohibendi, and (fila
oertain jus utendi, or in other words, (a) a oertaiu negative servitude,
