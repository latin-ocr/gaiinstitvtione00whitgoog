repay a debt, no length of time barred the defendant from pleading
the exceptio doli. Ii the plaintiff, instead cf suing on the stipulatio,
eued simply on a loan by the informal real contract of mutuum, the
defence of the defendant, though substantially the same, viz. that
he had never received the money, being a mere contradiction of
the intentio, would not appear in the formula in the shape of an
exceptio. In this case the burden of procf that the money had
been actually lent would naturally fall cn the plaintiff. (For the
circumstances under which a defence took the form of exceptio
see 4 ξ 115.)

lt may assist usin understanding the distinction of Formless and
Formal contracte, that is Verbal and literatis, before we quit thie
subject, we cast a hasty glance at the corresponding institutione of
English law.

In the eye of the English law, contracte are either Simple (parol),
that is, enforceable only on proof of consideration, or Specinl, that
is, binding by the solemnity of their form. Special contracte are
either contracte under Seal or contracte of Record. A common
species of Deed, or written contract under seal, ie the Bond or
Obligation, which, like Stipulatio, is used to secure the payment
of money or performance of any other act, and, like stipulatio,
either binde the debtor alone or the debtor and sureties. It con·
siste cl cn obligctcry part or penal clause binding tho obligor to
pay a sum of money, and a condition added, that if he does some
particular act the obligation shall be void, but else shall remain in
full force.

Contracta of Record are either recognizances or J udgment dehts.

A Recognizance isan acknowledgment before a court or magi·
strate that a man owse the King or a private plaintiff (as tha case
may be) a certain sum of money, with a condition avoiding the
obligation to pay if he shall do some particular act, as, if he
shall appear at the assises, keep the peace, pay a certain debt,
or the like. A Recognirance resembles stipulation in its form,
being entered into by cral interrogation and anewer, but differs
in that it can only be taken before a court or magistrate duly
authorized, whereas stipulatio was transacted between private
pertice.

A Judgment debt, cr debt due by the judgment of a court cf
record, is sometimes the result of ajudgment in an adverse suit,
but sometimes it is merelya form of written contract, and may be
entered into in various ways. A fictitious action ie brought, and
the party to be bound either makes no reply, or faile to instruct his
attorney, or confessas the action and suffers judgment to be ct once
entered up; or the party to be bound consents to ajudge's order
