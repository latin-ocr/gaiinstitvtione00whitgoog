The denial by a defendant that he had received money from
a plaintiff would not, in an actio Mutui, appear cn the face of the
formula: as a simple Negaticn of tha plaintill's right, it would fall
under the first line of defence. It would only assume the form of
Exceptio doli, 5 116a, in an action brought on a stipulation. Hera
the promise of the defendant to repay would establish a right ol the
plaintiff ι but the absence cf a previous psyment by the plaintiff
would give the defendant a countervailing right, to be alleged in an
exceptio dcli, which as in other cases of exception he would have
to prove. It was, however, a usual practice, in the time cf the
. classical jurists and subsequently, for a borrower cf money, whether
under a contract of stipulaticn or an informal contract, tc give the
lendsr a written document, called cautio, us an acknowledgmeut
cf his having received it A defendant, who had given such an
aclmowledgmsnt without having in fact received the money
would defend himself in all cases by the exceptio doli or exceptio
non numeratae pecuniae, as it came to be called. It wesprovided
by a constitution of the Empercrs Severus and Antoninus, s. n. 215,
that if an action was brought on such a cautio, and the exceptio non
numeratae pecuniae was pleaded indefense, the burden of proving
that the money, which was claimed, had been paid should be cn
the plaintiff instead of being, as in other cases of exception, on the
defendant, cod. 4, 30, 3. But, us we have seen, the rule was
established that if the person who had given the cautio allowed
a certain period tc elapse from the time when it was given, tha
acknowledgment should be considered presumptive evidence cf the
money having been received. The period was first fixed at one
year, then extended by Diocletian to five years, and finally reduced
by Justinian to two, ch. 4, 30, 14. cf. inst. 3, 21, and see 3 ἕξ 97-

exception, but also an action and an in integrum rmtitutio. me
words of the edict: Ait praetor: Quod metus causa gestum erit
ratum non habebo, Dig. 4, 2, 1, ‘Duress shall be a ground for
rescinding any dispositicm’ are in rem scripta thetis general or
impersonal: they are not merely aimed against the intimidatcr, but
promise a remedy even against innocent persons who may have come
into possession of property previously acquired by reason of intimi·
dation. 'Phe actio quod metus causa was an actio arbitraria, ξ 47,

comm, and during one year the defendant was condemned to pay
fourfold damagss if he did not make restitution according tc the order
of the judex: after that it only lay for simple damagss The formula
may be thus restored: Si paret metus causa Aulum Agerium fundum
illum Numerio Negidio mancipio dedisse neque ea res arbitrio tue
