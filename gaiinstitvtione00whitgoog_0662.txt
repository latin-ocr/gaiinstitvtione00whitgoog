was established bytho other party: that if the possession 01 the
actual possessor was tainted with one of three vices, if it was
acquired from the other party furtively (clam), acquired from him by
violence (vi), or held 01 him by his leave (precario), then his adverssry
recovered possession. What, then, it may be selred, was the use 01
0 distinct interdici Recuperandae possessionis, the interdict Unde vi,
which, like the Uti possidetis, was only available for a year? The
answer is, that Uti possidetis could only have the effect of restoring
possession when the dispossessor was in present possession3 it gave
no redress when a third party was the present possessor: in such cases
the party dispossessed required a different remedy, and this vves given
him 10 the interdici Unde vi, which could be maintained againsta ᾗ
dispossessor for damages, whether the latter continued in possession
or 001. Further, by Uti possidetis the intermediste profits (1100100)
were only recoverable from the commeneement 01 the suit, by Unde vi
from the time 01 the ejectm2ent3 and the remedy 01 the dispossemsd
person by Uti possidetis was barred by the vices of his own posses· ,
sion, not so his remedy by Unde vi, though, as we see hy the text,
§§ 154, 155, this difference only applied to vis armata, when Gaius
wrote.

As violent dispossession was remedied by the interdict Unde vi, so
other interdicte remedied disposseasion whose inception was claudes
tine or permissive. An interdict De clandestina possessione seems
10 be mentioned, Dig. 10, 3, 7, 5, though this more probably refers to
0 particular application 01 the interdict Uti possidetis, than to be
aspecial interdict 01 itself (cf. Lenel, p. 377, 0. 7). Such 0 special
interdict would scarcely be required in the case 01 immovables, ior
as 0 possessor was not dispossessed until he had notice of the
invasion, he could immediately maintain Uti possidetis, Dig. 41, 2,
,6, l-retinet ergo possessionem qui ad nundinas 010111- or he could
1)] attempting an entry convert the clandestine 1010Ι 0 violent dis-
possession. Nor would it be required for movables, for clandestine
dispossession of amovebis might be redressed by Utrubi combined,
perhaps, with an exhibitcry interdict or order 01 productior.

· Accordingly, it is 'generally supposed that no special interdict

against clandestine dispossession ever existed.

The interdict De precario was in these terms; Quod precario ab
illo habes 001 (1010 malo fecisti, ut desineres habere, que de re agitur,
id illi restituas, Dig. 43, 26, 2, pr. ί’.1100 possession 01 the thing in
question which thou holdest by the permission 01 such a one, or hest
fraudulently ceased to hold, do thou restore to him’

Before we quit this topic we may take the opportunity of considering
some of the respecta in which the relation called Precarium differed
from a closely allied institution, the contract called Commodatum.
