relation of the membere ola Univereitas must not be identified with ,

that ol (lc-proprietate (communio). A coproprietor is the separate
proprietor ol an undivided ideal portion, which he can aliene, mort
gage, and otherwise dispose ol 3 and which, by requiring a partition
(actio communi dividundo), 114 41111 always reduce to a real portion:
whereas the whole of the common property can only be dealt with
if the coproprietors are unanimous. Members of a Universitas,
on the contrary, cannot demand a partition; and dispositione of ι
the property ol the Universitae can only be made by the vote
ol a majority, sometimes only by a majority of two-thirde ol the
members.

Every juristic person was originally incapable ol being instituted
heir, as Pliny mentions in the case of municipalitiee: Nec heredem
institui nec praecipere posse rempublicam constat, Epist 5, 7.
‘Neither an inheritance nor a legacy by praeceptio (which implies
that the legates is aleo heir, 2 ξ 217) can be left to a municipality.'
Juristic persons were not, as is sometimes stated by Roman juriets,
subject to thie incapacity simply because, owing to the idea of
an artificial person not having yet been distinctly formed, they
were regarded as personae incertae, 2 ς 238, but also because, being
fictione, they were incapablc oi entering on sn inheritance (aditio),
which involves acceptance on the part of the heir, and excludes
representation. Piret the senate, dieregarding this difficulty, allowed
municipalitiee to be instituted heire by their own liberti, Ulpian 22, 5:
and subsequently the Emperor Leo, aa. 469, gave to municipalities
the capacity cl being instituted heir by any testator, uod. 6, 24, 12.
No general enactment extended this capacity to all Oorpomtions, but
some received it as a special privilege.

Originally municipalitiee, like other juristic persone, were in·
capable oi taking beqnests (legata), but subsequently they were
declared capable by Nerva and Hadrian, Ulpian 24, 28; 2 ξ 195:
and this capacity was extended tc collegia, Templa and Ohurchee,
Dig. 34, 5, 20. Towne were aleo capable of taking successione by
fideicommissum, Ulpian 22, ὀ.

Under Christian legislation Picus Foundationa (pia corpora) were
made capable ol taking hereditas and legatum: and testamentary
dispositione oi hereditas and legatum, that would otherwise have
been void by the rule avoiding deviaes to incerta persona, e. g. a devise
