ξ 117. The necessity of using formal words in the institution cf
an heir was abolished by a constitution of constantius and Constans,
ammffinmw

As to the nomenclatura employed in the following exposition of
Roman testamentary law, it must be observed that as the Roman
conception ol Heres is not found in English law, so we have no legal
term corresponding to it. In the language oi English jurisprudence
Heir denotas a successor to real estam, while Executor, the notion of
which is derived to some extant from Roman law, denotas a successor
appointed to succeed to personal property. Again Heir denotes a suc·
cessar to real estate in case of intestaoy. Devisee denotes a successor
to mal estate under a will.

The word Executor is not avallable as a translation of heros The
Executor of English law, unless also a legatae, holds s merely onerous
office; whereas the heres of Roman law was always, if there was any

¹ residueabeueficiary. 'Phe Roman heres, in fact, united the characters

of the English Executor and residuary legatae: and the lex Falcidia
provided that the residue should as against the claims oi legatus always
amount to a fourth of thelestetor’s property. Nor is the executor, like

the heres, personally liable for the debts of the deceased beyond assets.

In translatiug the word Heres heir, which is convenient from its

’ relation to the indispensable terme disiuherit and disinheritance, an
Ι English reader must not be misled by false associatione with Real
l Property law, but must understand that it is used to signify the
l Universal successor oi Roman law, whether designated by will or by

s the mles of intestacy.
Ι Bequest (which in English law is related to personalty ae devise
lc realty) has been used in connexion with legacies, i. e. with dis·

³ positione in favour of legatarius ae opposed to heres; in favour,
, thetis, oi a person who takes a single thing or things belonging to .

the testator, nothis familis, that is, the Universites of his rights and
obligations, or a fractior of this Universitas.

§i 119, 120. The praetor only sustained a testament in spite ol its
civil invalidity when the grounds of civil invalidity were want of
mere extarnal formalities (mancipation, nuncupatim), not against
more serious defects, such es preterition of seli-successor. He
sistained it, however, against the preterition of suus postumus, if

suus postumus died before the testator, Dig. 28, 3, 12.
