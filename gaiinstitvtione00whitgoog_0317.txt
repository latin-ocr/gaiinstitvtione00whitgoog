11. 44246250] DE FIDEIOOMM. HEREDITATIBVS 257

proviso, that, though a transferres is generally not entitled toa
Falcidian fourth, yet if a transferres who has to bear the burdsn
of legacies receives the inheritance reduced bytho Falcidian fourth
of 4110 heres, he 40 himself entitled to reduce proportionally the
legacies and retain a fourth thereos for himself. Dig. 35, 1, 43, 3;
35, 2, 32, 4. Ε. g. a testator, proprietor of 400, 11101100 A his sole
heres, requesting him to transfer the whole inheritance to Β after
deductiori of legacies, and leaves a legacy of 300 40 Ο. Τ110 result
is that the heir retains ὲ (100); and the remaining 300 40 dis·
tributed between the legates and transferres, the legatae taking
300 reduced by 3, (225), and the transferres taking that ὲ (75).
The same effect would have 110011 produced 44 ths testator, instead
of using the clause deductis legatie, had simply charged the legacies
cn ths fideicommissarius. Or the rights of 4410 fideicommissarius
may be calculated with 4410 same result by 4110 following method.
'Phe heres retains 4 and transfers Ξ 40 4410 cestui qus trust, who under
Justinian’s legislation is no longer a partiary legatae as he was
under the Sc. Pegasianum, but a sharer of the inheritanoe with

ἦ 4110 410100 411 4410 proportion of 2³,- 40 4, Τ110 legatae is entitled
ἶ 40300 410111 these 00410410 411 4110 proportion of their ahares of

tho inheritance. The heres, however, is protected by tho lex
Falcidia, and thus ὲ 04 4410 legacy is lost to the legatae: hs obtains,
however, 4 (225) from the transferres, who retains for himself the
remaining 4 (75).

(3) If the heres makes voluntary aditio, but does 1104 retain the

¹ Falcidiam fourth to which he is entitlsd, then, if the legaoy was

charged 011 4110 inheritance, the whole inhsritanoe is divided between
the transferres and legates in the proportior of 4 40 3: that 40, the
transferres obtains altogether 2284, and 4110 legatae 1713..

(4) If 4410 legacy was expressly charged on 4110 fideicommissarius.
or if there was no express clause defining whether it was charged
on him 01011 4110110100, then 4110 legates will benefit by the 110100
abstaining from 4140 fourth: and the transferres will only get
what remains after full payment 04 the legacy. Thus, in the
circumstances we have assumed, the legates will get 300 and the
transferres 100.

(5) If the heres abstains from his 4 expressly in favour of the
transferres, the latter alone gets the henefit 04 011041 abstention.

(6) 14 4410 heres only malros compulsory aditio, hs takes no share
of the Falcidiae fourth, which all goes to the account of the trans·
ferree who compelled the 11010040 make aditio. Dig. 36, l, 2.

(7) If the 110100 has to transfer the whole but has received his
Falcidian fourth 4114410 shape of legacies, the transferres has to
satisfy the other legatses: and if 410 munet pay the whole 04 their
