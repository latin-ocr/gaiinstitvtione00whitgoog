respect ol the obligations acquired by the son, the same principle
was to prevail, Inst. 3, 28, pr. ‘What is realized from obligations
acquired by a son shall be divided, as his property is by our
constitution, into ownership and usufruct3 so that the usufruet of
the proceeds of any action shall vest in the father, and in the son aa
owner, the whole right of action vesting in the father, according
to the distinctions expressed in the statute!

of Sabinus, Inst 3, 28, 13.

To the persons through whom an obligatiou could bc acquired
might ba added in modern systema of law the procurator or agent,
when the contract of the agent is treated as if it had been made by
the principal himself. But Roman law always regarded the agent
who made the contract as the party to it, in other words it did not
admit the principle of contractual agency. (ll. § 162, comm.
