111. estrei] BONORVM vnuumo aar

A period of forty or twenty days having thus been completed
from the first missio in possessionem, the sale took place by public
auction, the universitas juris of the debtor being transferred to the
bidder who offered the creditore the highest dividend, that is, the
greatest amount in the pound on their respective claims. As vve see
by the text, ξ 80, the purchaser became bonitary, not quiritary,
owner of the insolvent’s property, and he could only sue or be sued
by actiones ficticiae or utiles, not by actiones directae, 4 ξ 35.

The principal acts or defaults, which entitled a Roman creditor
to bonorum venditio, may be compared with those which entitle
an English creditor to petition for an adjudication in bankruptcy‚
i. e. to the socalled acts of bankruptey of English jurisprudence.

(ι) As manus injectio might be founded on a previous judgment
or an admission of debt (res judicata or aas confessum), and missio
in possessionem might be granted against judicatus vvho makes
default, so in English law non-payment of an admitted ora judgment
debt after service of a debtor’s summons is an aet of bankruptcy,
and instead oi euing out averit of execution the creditor may petition
for adjudication of banluuptcy.

(a) When there is no previous judgment or admission of debt,
a debtor vvho absconde or secretos himself, with intent to defraud his
oreditors, commite an aet of bankruptcy in both systema of law.
In English law, for instance, if a debtor makes an appointment
with a creditor to meet at the debtor's place of business, and avoids
the meeting with the intention of delaying the creditor; or if he
withdraws from his usual counting·house to a roem upstairs, to
avoid the rightful and personal solicitation of his creditore for pay·
ment, he commite an act of bankruptcy. So in Roman lawr Praetor
ait: In bona ejus qui judicio sistendi eausa fidejussorem dedit, si
neque potestatem sui faciet neque defendetur, iri jubebo, Dig. 42,
4, 2. ‘The praetor says in the edict: If a man enter into a hond
with suretyship to appear at a trial, and neither appears in person
nor by procurator, I will permit the plaintiff to seiza his goods'
Agaiu: Praetor ait: Qui fraudationis causa latitabit, si honi viri
arbitratu non defendetur, ejus bona possideri vendique jubebo, Dig.
42, 7, 1. ‘The praetor says in the edict: If a man secrete himself
with intent to defraud his oreditors, and is not defended by a pro·
curator who gives seeurity approved by an arbitrator, I will order
his property to be seized and sold.’ Of. § 78.

There is no adjudication ol bankruptcy against a deceased debtor
in English law, but there may ba a liquidation of his property as in
Roman law; there are special rules for the administration of pro·
party in such cases, oreditors, in default of other administratore,
being entitlad to take out letters of administration against the estate
