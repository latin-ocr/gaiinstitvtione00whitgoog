or of any other of the essentialia negotii, or from absence of the
prescribed form in which an intention is required to be declared.

(b) Or prohibition of the disposition by positive law.

The antagonism oi the law to a particular kind of disposition
might express itself in various ways:

(ι) It might prohibita disposition, but if it was entered into
and carried out in a particular way neither rescind it nor impose
a penalty on account of the prohibition being disregarded. Such a
law is perhaps what Ulpian, 1, 1, denominatas au imperfecte lex: it
is exemplified by lex Oineia, a. c. 204, which prohibited gifts above
a certain amount.

(2) It might prohibit a disposition but, instead oi declaring it
invalid, impose a penalty on the person by whom it was enforced.
This was the method of lex Furia testamentaria, which imposesa
scuriold penalty on those who take a legacy above a certain sum,
aud which Ulpian‚ l. c.‚ quotes asan example oi minus quam perfecta
lex, 2 ξ 225, comm.

(3) It might prohibit a disposition but only atrike it with a partial
invalidity: allowing it to create a valid right, but making such right
subject to be deprived of its efficacy by Exceptio. Such an exceptio
might be of the weaker class, only barring obligatio civilia a g. ex·
ceptio Sc. Macedoniani, 3 §t 90-91, comm.; or of the stronger clam,
barring both civilis and naturalis obligatio; e. g. exceptio Sc.
Vellaeani, 3 §5 110-127, comm.

(4) It might declara the prohibited disposition to be entirely
invalid. Such an ordinance ia called by Ulpian perlecta lex, andis
exemplified in lex Falcidia, 2 § 227.

Informality, eg. omission to institute or disinherit suus heres,
mancipation without the required number of witnesses, donation
without record (insinuatio), produces Nullificatien.

The second oi these paths of prohibition ceased to be trodden after
an interpretative law of Theodosius ΙΙ, a. n. 4³9. A law prohibit‘mg
municipal senators (curiales) from the management (procuratio) of
other persons' estates had been evaded by means of simulated leases
(conductio), cod. 4, 65, 30. In consequence of this, Theodosius
enacted in substance, that any prohibitiva law, even though it con·
tained no express terms of nullification, should be interpreted to
be lex perfecta3 and that any simulated dispositione, whereby a law
was attempted to be evaded‚ should be null and void: Nullum enim
pactum, nullam conventionem, nullum contractum inter eos videri
volumus subsecutum, qui contrahunt, lege contrahere prohibente.
Quod ad omnes etiam legum interpretationes tam veteres quam
novellas trahi generaliter imperamus, ut legis latori, quod fieri non
vult, tantmn prohibuisse sufficiat, cetera quasi expressa ex legis
