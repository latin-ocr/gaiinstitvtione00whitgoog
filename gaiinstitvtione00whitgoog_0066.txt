Another organ of quasi publication, whereby the rules of jus
gentium were transformed from ideal law to positive law-from
laws of Utopia to laws of Rome-were the writings of the jurists,
who, at first with the tacit, afterwards with the express permission
of the legislatore, engaged, nominally in interpreting, really in
extending the lew, about the time of Cicero (De Legibus, ξ 1, 5),
transferred to the edict of the praetor the activity which they had
formerly displayed in developing the law of the Twelve Tables and
the statutas of the Comitia By these means, supplemented and
confirmed by statute law and custom, the jus gentium gradually
increased in importante, and gave tho Roman empire its universal
law.

J us civile, i. e. jus civium or law peculiar to citizens, was the law
of the Twelve Tables, augmented by subsequent legislation, by juristic
interpretation, and by consuetudinary lew. 'lhe institutione of jus
civile may be exemplified by such titles to property as Mancipetio
and In Jure Cossio, contracte by the form of Nexum and Sponsio,
title to intestata succession by Agnetio or civil relationship; while
corresponding institutione of jub gentium were the acquisition of
property by Tradition, contract by Stipulation without the solemn
term Spondeo, title to intestata succession by cognatio cr natural
relationship. Other departments of life were not subject to parallel
institutes of jus civile and jus gentium, bnt the mutual relations of
citizens with citizens as well as of citizens with aliens were exclu-
sively controlled by jus gentiumz e. g. the informal contracte called
consensual, such as buying and selling, letting and hiring, partner·
ship3 and the informal contracte called Real, such as the contract of
loan for use or loan for consumption.

Titles to ownership (jus in rern), according to jus gentium, which
ultimately superseded civil titles, are explained at large in Book IL

In respect of Obligation (jus in personam), jus gentium may be
divided into two classes, according to the degree in which it was
recognized by civil lew :-

A· A portion of jue gentium was recognized as a ground of
Action. To this class belong (l) the simple or Formless contracte
to which we heve alluded, (2) obligations to indemnify grounded
cn delict, (³) rights qrrasi ex contractu to recover property when it
hasbeen lost by one side and gained by the other without any right
to retain it. Dig. 12, 6, 14 and Dig. 25, 2, 25. Actione founded on
this obligation to restore (condictiones), although it was a species of
naturalis obligatio, Dig. 12, 6, 15 pn, were as rigorous (stricti juris)
ae eny in the Oivil code. In these cases the obligatio, though
naturalis as founded in jus gentium, yet, es actionable, was said
to be civilis obligatio, not naturalis, Dig. 19, 5, t, 1.
