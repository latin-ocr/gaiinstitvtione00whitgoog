deposited, as well as possession, contrary to the general rule pasees to
the depositary. Dig. 16, 3, 24. The passages in the Digest relating
ιο this show that Banking in the modern senso of the word, i. e. the
payment of a small interest to depositors and receipt of a largar
interest from horrowers of the deposit, was practised by Roman
Mensularii, Vangerow, ξ 630.

Pignus, pledge, pawn, or mortgage, is the creation of a real right
(jus in re aliena) in athing, movable or immorable, to ιο held asa

, security for a debt, and to be retransferred when the debt is satisfied.

But this conception of pignus was only reached by gradual steps.

There are three forms of giving real security ιο a creditor, cor-
responding ιο three eras in the development of Roman law, which
must be separatsly examined.

(r) The earliest is not in the regular form of a pledge, being effectod
by a mancipatio or in jure cessio of property, accompanisd with a
fiducia, or fiduciary agreement for reconveyance, cf. 2 ξ 66. As
a form of security, itis analogous in principle to the English
common la'w mortgage, the ownership in the thing pledged being
conveyed to the creditor on the understanding that he is ιο reconvey
it when the debt is paid. The security which this gives to the
creditor is that ιο can recover the thing by vindicatio from any
possessor of it, and can sell it as he pleases, though he is liable ιο

“ ιιο debtor in the actio fiduciae, ifhe exercises his right improperly.

rPhia personat action is the only remedy which tho debtor has in
respect of the property which he has made overas security for his
debt, as having parted with the ownership he has no actio in rem
for recovery of it from third parties. But in course of time it
seems to have become a common practice for the creditor to allow
the debtor to keep possession of the pledge, tha latter holding it of
him by leave and licence (precario) and having interdict possession of
it. 'I'ho unsatisfactory character of this way of securing a creditor,
considered from the point of view of the debtor, is obvious Yet in
a tablet found at the mouth of tho Guadalquivir, which probably
belongs ιο ιιο first century after christ, we sse that it was still in
use not long before the time when Gaius wrote (Bruns, Fontes,
ed. 6, no. 110).

(a) Pignus, in the strict sense, was affected simply by delivery of
possession without injure cessio or mancipatio. The debtor continued
to be owner of the thing pledged, the creditor or pledgee only
acquiring interdictpossession of it. But a condition was sometimes
inserted in the agreement, by which it was agreed that the thing
given in security should become the property of the creditor in case
of default (lex commissoris), though by later law such a condition
was made void
