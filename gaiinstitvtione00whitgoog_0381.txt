smirnam. Wherever mutual promises are proffered and accepted
there are in strictness two or more obligations; but where one of
the promises is thus made to depend on the other, the several obliga·
tione aro cross or implicated, and therefore are commonly deemed
to arise from one agreement. Where one only of the agreeing parties
gives a promise, the proffered and accepted promise is called aUni·
lateral agreement; where each gives a promise, and the promise of
one is made to depend on the promise of the other, the several
proffered and accepted promises are calledaBilateral orSynallagmatic
agreement. Under a unilateral agreement only one party can sue
or he sued, under a bilateral agreement each party may sue or be
sued in turn. 'Phe sole Unilateral agreements or contracte mentioned
hy Gaius are Expensilatio, Stipulatio, Mutuum. EmptioVenditio,
Locatio-Oonduotio, Societas, are examples of Bilateral agreements.
Depositum, commodatum, Pignus, Mandatum, are called imperfectly
Bilateral agreements, because they do not necessarily and originally
produce any reciproca] obligation, but only ex postfacto, i. e. in con·
sequence of some circumstance incidental to the agreement, as a claim
of depositarius to be indemnified on account of some necessary expense
he had been putto in respectos the thing deposited with him. The
action founded on the original and principal obligation of a semi·
bilateral agreement, ie. the action of the depositor, lender for use,
pawnor, or person giving the mandate, is called judicium directum or
actio directa: the action founded on the incidental or ex postfacto
obligation, i. e. the action of the depositary, borrower lor use, pawnee,
agent, is called judicium contrarium or ectio contraria. 'Phe Unilateral
agreements abore mentioned, even though, lilre Mutuum, institutions
of Jus gentium, give rise to condictiones or actions of strict law
(stricti juris actiones); bilateral and semi-bilatersl agreements give
rise to equitable actions (honae fidei actiones).

The classitication of contracte by Gaius does not include the
Nexum, which seems to have been a form of contracting in early
law. No precise information concerning its characteristica have come
down to us, and hence modern writers frequently differ in their
explanation of it. (See Muirhead’s Roman Law, p. 1513 Roby,
Roman Private Law, Bk. V. App. B; Sohm, pp. 52, 392.) Nexum
is sometimes used in a general sense to include all proceedings
carried out per ass et libram, while it is elsewhere distinguished
from mancipation. Nexum Manilius scribit omne quod per libram
et aes geritur, in quo sint mancipia. Mucius quae per aes et libram
fiant ut obligentur, praeterquam mancipio detur. Hoc verius esee
ipsum verbum ostendit, de quo quaeritur; narn id estquod obligatur
per libram neque suum fit, inde nexum dictum. Varro, L. L. 7, 105.
