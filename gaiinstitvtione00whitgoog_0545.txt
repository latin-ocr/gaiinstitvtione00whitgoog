Sc when by the lex Falcidia all legacies were proportionally abatad
until a fourth remained to the heir, it was necessary, in order ιο
enable the legates ιο avoid plus petitio, to allow him to ascertain
the amount cf the inheritauce by a preliminary inquiry: Oum
dicitur lex Falcidia locum habere, arbiter dari solet ad ineundam
quantitatem bonorum, Dig. ³5, 3, 1, 6. ‘When Falcidia is alleged
to be applicabis, an arbiter is appointed tc ascertain the amount ot
the inheritauce!

Could a formula conciat solely oi a Demonstratio and a Gon·
demnatio? Yes, if Savigny is right in supposing, ι ³12, that the
Praetor sometimes granted a formula oi the following shape:

Quod Aulus Agerius juravit, Numerium Negidium fundum Ocr-
nelianum ipsi dare oportere, quanti is fundus est, sum condemna.
‘Whereas the plaintiff has swern that the defendant owse him such
and such a thing, do thou, judex, condemn the defendant ιο pay
him its value!

'Fo explain this we must notice a peculiar use of the cath (jus-
jurandum) in Roman litigation.

The Teutonis tribes, including our ancestors, allowed a defendant
to purge himself by his own oath supported by the cath of a certain
number oi his neighbours; of which institution we have a vestigo
in the Wager oi law, which was recently an incident of the action
of Detinue, in which the defendant might clear himself by his own
cath and that oi eleveu compurgatcrs. With such principles oi
evidence it is not surprising that in the German foresta the struggle
between litigante was not, who should escape the burden ol proci but,
who should enjoy the privilege ol proof. The Roman method was
not so liabls tc abuse. Either litigant might tender (deferre, delatio)
an cath ιο his adversary‚ ie. effer to be concluded by his adversary's
ooth, on an issue either of fact or of law (aa ιο the existence oi
obligation,ownsrship,suocession,&ct The cath was then equivalent
ιο ajudgment in favour ol the person by whom it was swern, Inst.
4, 1³, 4. If a litigant was prepared to taire an cath his adversary
might release him from actually swearing (dare, praestare jusjuran.
dum); but this release (remittere, remissiolwasequivalenttoanactual
oath. Instead oi taking a tendered oath, the adversary might malie
a counter-teoder (referre, relatio), i.e. submit the issue to the oath
of the original tenderet. Το decline either to swear or to make
a couniret-tendor was equivalent to a confession oi the party who
declined, or to an oath citha party who tendered. From this
necessity imposed on the party to whom it was tendered, the oath
was called jusjurandum necessarium, Dig. 12, 2, 34, 6. Π now on
a tender or counter·teuder by a defendant a plaintiff swore to the
justice of his claim, the assessment of damages (rei aestimatio)
