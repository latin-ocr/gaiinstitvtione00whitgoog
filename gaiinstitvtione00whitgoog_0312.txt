tution of the slave of the person whose benefit was intended, bae

The conversion of a moral intc a legal obligation by the legalita-
tion of truste was similar to what occurred when, under the Twelve
Tables, legal force wae given to the mancipatio cum fiducia, declaring
the conditione and pur-posce 01 0 remancipation, 2 5 60; and,
remembering the celebrated ordinance, (lum nexum faxit manci·
piumque, uti lingua nuncupaesit, itu jus esto, it may occur to us to
wonder why Augustus did not imitate the energetic brevity 01 the
ancient legislator, and simply enact, Cum testamentum faxit codi-
cillosve‚ uti fideicommiserit, ita jus esto. There would then have
been nc need of the cumbrous machinery of fictitious sales and
stipulatione between quasi vendor and quasi vendee; but a little
reflection will show that such an enactment would have operated
very inconveniently, and have defeated the very purposes for which
truste were instituted. Such an enactment would have made tmste,
like nuncupatione, a matter of civil law; and the jus strictum 01
the civil law was far from elastic or rational even in the time
of Augustue; so thetis it was intended to enlarge the powers of
testatore and the discretion of the fiduciary tribunal, it was abso
lutely necessary tc malie truste a province not 01 legal but of
equitable jurisdictiou.

ξ 251. The transferres, it will be seen, was quasi heir when the
Sc. Trebellianum applied: when the Sc. Pegasianum applied he was
either quasi legatee or quasi vendee.

ξ 252. These stipulatione were employed because the fictiticue sale
(dicis causa, nummo uno) of the inheritance produced no universal
suocession, and eo did not transfer the liability. But after Antoninus
Pius these stipulatione were not required in case 01 an actual sale
of an inheritance, for though this did not operate as a universal
succession, it involved a ceseion of actions. Dig. 2, 14, 16; ct Dig.

ξ 253. The terme 01 the Sc. Trebellianum, passed in the reign of
Nero, probably a, n. 57, are given in the Digest 36, 1, 1 and 2. ‘Foras-
much ae equity requires that whenever an inhcritanceis leit in trust,
any actione arieing thereout should be brought against the transferres
ol the inheritanoe or by him, rather than that the fiduciary heir
should incur any risk in consequence ot hie trust3 it ie decreed that
the actions of and against an heir, shall not be granted to or against
an heir who transfers a succession in pursuance of a trust, but to
and against the testamentary transferree, in order that in future the
last wishes of testatore may have more effect) It is strange that
the lawgiver should have stocped to the use 01 fiction (actio utilis),
the natural instrument of a magistrate timidly usurping legislative
