brought Cascellianum he only recovered the Res without the interim
fructus. 'Phe satisdatio would thus increase his certainty of obtaining
the amount 01 the penal sum, but would diminish by the value of the
fructus the total amount recovered.

Oonesponding to the penal sum incurred by l'ructus licitatio, and
secured by (a) Fructuaria stipulatio or Satisdstio of the litigant who
obtains possession pending interdici procedure, was the liability
in twice tlre value of the fructus incurred by the litigant who
obtained possession by Vindiciae dicendae pending statute-process.
Such at least appears to be the impert of ¹a partly conjectural frag·
ment of the Twelve Tables (Tab. 12, 3): Si vindiciam falsam tulit,
si velit is .,. 101 arbitros tris dato, eorum arbitrio . . . fructus
duplione damnum decidito. Festus ‘When temporary possession
has been wrongfully obtained (the question of property and the
value of the fruits of possession) may be decided by three arbiters,
by whose arbitration the wrongful possessor shall pay as a penalty
twice the value 01 the fruits of possession to the true proprietor.’

§ 170. From this paragraph it appears that as in Real actions the
defendant who declined to give satisdatio judicatum solvi and thus
impeded the process of the action was deprived of possession by the
interdicte Quem fundum, Quam hereditatem, Quem usumfructum,
5156, comm.; so a suitor whose contumacious refusal to take the
regular steps prevented interdict procedure from accomplishing its
normal course was deprived of possession by interdicta secundaria.

The mention 0111011101 vnr non faciet) shows that, subsequent
to the issue of the interdict and antecedent to further proceedings,
one act of the forensis drama was a conventional ejectment (vis ex
conventu), cf. 1 166, comm.; which has been identified by some
writers with what is called Deductio quae moribus fit in suits by
Sponsio, and perhaps with the Mannum consertio in Sacramentum,
1 88, comm, 1 13, comm.

'Phe inquiry into the nature of rossaasrort has been purposely
postponed hitherto in order not 10 interrupi the exposition by Gaius
01 the details of the possessory interdicte (Utrubi, Uti possidetis,
Unde vi); ie. those interdicta in which the mere fect of possession
is itself a title to the continuance or restoration of possession (as to
the nature of possession cf. Sohm, 1 67).

Possession may be defined as a relation which consiste 01 two
elements3 Detention, 01 physical power over a thing, exercised
either by· oneself 01 by some other person as one's representative,
a g. by depositarius or commodatarius for depositor or commodator,
and Animus domini, a certain intention 011 the part of the person in
possession, the intention of holding it against others as a proprietor
would, and so 01 deriving from it the benedis of ownership.
