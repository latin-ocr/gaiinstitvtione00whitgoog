might take the whole estate as heiress, if her father died intestato:
but Romans were very averse to dying intestata ; andin this event
she would not bave had a testamentary guardian and so have been
much hampered in the 1111 disposition of her property, at least till
the agnatio guardianship of women was abolished.

1227. 'Fhe terms 11 the principal clause of the lex Falcidia, passed
n o. 40, are given in the Digest 35, 2, 1, pr. ‘Every Roman citizen
who, after this law pasees, makes awill, is entitled and empowered to
give and bequeath whatever money he likes to any Roman citizen in
accordance with the laws of Rome, provided that such bequest leave
at least one fourth of the inheritance to be taken under that will by
the heire. Such hequests the legatees are permitted to accept without
penalty (sine fraude) (an allusion to the penalty of the lex Furia), and
the heir therewith charged is bound to pay! '

The words limiting the operation oi the 111 Falcidia to willa
executed after the date of its enactment taho this law out ol the
general rule respecting the temporal limite of the application of
laws in the event ol legislative innovatione. 'Fhe general rule for
determining, on any change of the law, whether a given right 11 10
be governed by the older or the newer law, is the principle that
anew law should have no retroactive influence on vested rights
(acquired rights), but should govern all that have yet to vest. Now
under a will no one has vested rights, whatever his expectatione,
before the death of the testator. This date 111111 the possible opening
of the succession (vocatio heredis, delatio hereditatis), the vesting oi
the rights of the heir and also of the legatee (legatorum dies cedens,
ξ 244), unless this is postponed till a later date, and determines the
law by which they are governed. Bytho general rule, then, the
111 Falcidia would have applied to all wills whose testatore died aster
its enactment, at whatever date they were executed. 'Fhe legislator
wished to disarm the opposition ef those who had made their willa
by excepting them 111111 111 operation; though in many cases the
111 Falcidia would be less rigorous than the 111 111111 and lex
Voconia, which it superseded, and testatore would be glad to revise
their testamentary dispositione. Savigny, System, ξ 394.

Some illustratione of the joint operation ol the lex Falcidia and
the So. Pegasianum, or rather the So. Trebellianum as modified by
J ustinian, will be presently given. ξ 259, comm.
