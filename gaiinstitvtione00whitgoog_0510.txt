as often as the wrong is repeated: or the Chaucery or other Divisicn

As the perfect right oi Ownerahip is supplemented by a lese
perfect right, the right of Possession, protected to some extent by
possessory interdicte instead ct by vindicatio, the remedy ci Owner·

aServitudeis supplemented by an imperfect right, a right ot' Quad-
pcssessicn, also protected by Interdicis, some identical in character
with those which protect Possession, some varying with the nabere

ᾗ 4. Gaius points out that the Roman law of his day was illogical
in allowing condictio on account of stolen property, cf. Inst. 4, 6, ll,
no transfer oi ownership being operated by thcft Roman law
contained no disposition similar tc that cf English law, that property
in stolen goods pasees by sale in market overt. Even in the hands
of c third person, an innocent purchaser, the thing remained the
property oi the original owner, exempt irem the potent chemistry
oi usucapion. It follows that the action for obtaining restituticn
logically competent to the owner who still remained owner wne
vindicatio, and not an action based on an obligation to courcy
ownership to the plaintiff.

In the condictio ex causa furtiva, instead cf the intentio, Si paret
dare oportere, § 4, which implies that the plaintiff is not owner,
we might have expected him to sue with the intentio, quidquid paret
, Dare facere oportere, which might be merely a form oi claiming
damagcs ior the injury, and accordingly would be consistent with
his ownership. The explanation why the other formula was allowed
seems tc be that at the time when this remedy on account et furtum
was established condictio could only be brought on coccum of certa
pecunia or certa rea The form of condictio was perhaps adopted
iu this case, though at the eost ot an anomaly, in order to make the
action transmissible against the heirs of the delinquent, a delictal
action being intransmissible

§ 5. Condictic is an actio stricti juris, see ἐξ 18-20, comm. (For
the distinction which is sometimes drawn between condictio and
other kinds cf actiones st1icti juris see Sohm, 580, n. 6.) It therefore
excludes, besides allectione in rem, actions bonae fidei (which had an
intentio Quidquid dari fieri oportet ex fide bona, 547), and praeterita
acticus in personam ; moreover actions ex delicto with the exception
ct condictio furtiva, which, as we have seen, is anomalous, t 4, belong
to a different category. ln its original and striot torm it was
always Condictio certi, with an intentio, Si paret dare oportere. It
is either brought to recover a certain sum ol money, Condictio certae
