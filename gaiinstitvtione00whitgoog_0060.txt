liv HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION

inserted that he was not a practising lawyer; for amidst his
voluminous writings there is no trace of any work on Quaestionea
His treatises may all bave been of a professorial kind. They
included, beside the Institutione, Commentaries on the Provincial
Ediot and the Urban Edict3 a work on the Lex Julia et Papia
Poppaea3 aOommentary on the Twelve Tables3 ebook ealled Aurea or
Res Quotidianae, treating ol legal doctrines ol general applicetion and
utility in everyday life 3 a book on (lases (apparently of a hypothetica]
character); one on Rules oi Law (Regulae); and special treatises on
Verbal Obligations, Manumissions, Fideicommiese, Dowries, and
Hypotheoa. He also wrote on the Tertullian and Orphitiau Senatus·
oonsults. Gaius's Commentary on the Provincial Edict is the only
work 'of the kind known to us. It is not necessary to believe that
this Provincial Edict was the edict of the particular province
(perhaps Asia) of which he was a native. It may have been a
redaction of the clemente common to all Provincial Edicts ¹.

The velue attached to Gaius's powers of theoretical exposition,
and to the admirable clearness and method which mede bis Insti-
tutione the basis of all future teaching in Roman law, must have
been great ; for, in spite of the fact thet he was not a patented juris·
consult, he appears by the side of Papinian, Paulus, Ulpian, and
Modestinus, in the ‘Law of Citations’ issued by Theodosius II and
Valentinian 111 in 426 Α. n. The beginning of this enactment runs²2
‘We accord our approval to all the writings of Papinian, Paulus,
Gaius, Ulpian, and Modestinus, granting to Gaius the same authority
that is enjoyed by Paulus, Ulpian and the others, and sanctioniug
the citation of all his works.'

Although so little is known of Gaius, yet his date can be approxi-
mately determined from the interna] evidence of his works ‘We
know that he flourisbed under the Emperors Hadrian (117-138 nra),
Antoninus Pius (138-161nn.) and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
(161-180 ab.) Gaius himself mentions that he was acontemporary
of Hadrian, Dig. 34, 5, 7 pr. He apparently wrote the First Book
of his Institutione under Antoninus Pius, whom he mentions, § 53,
ξ 74, § 102, without the epithet Divus (of divine or venerable memory),
a term only applied to emperors after their decesso, but in the
Second Book, § 195, with this epithet. 'Phe Antoninus mentioued,
ξ 126, is either Pius or Marcus Aurelius Philosophus. Respecting
the rules of Oretio, 2. ξ 177 Gaius appears not to bc cognizant of

a constitution oi Marcus Aurelius mentioned by Ulpian, 22, 34.
That he survived to the time of commodus appears from his having
written a treatise ou the Se Orphitianum (178 nn), an enactment
