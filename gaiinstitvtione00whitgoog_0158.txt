servus was incapeble of matrimony: alapae from civis to Latinus
or peregrinus was a dissolution oi civil wedlock (connubium), for
this could only subsist between cives; but ii both parties consented,
they might continue in gentile wedlock (matrimonium), eod. 5, 17, 1.
'Phe confiscation of property or universal suceession oi the fiscus,
which accompanied greatest and minor loss of status, was not an
incident of the latter kind of eapitis minutio (e. g. it did not happen
when civis became Latinus by emigrati0n; and an alien, as
a citizen became by deportation, was capable of holding property),
but was a special provision oi the criminal code. (For an account
oi the different Roman forms of banishmeut see Mommsen, Rom.
Strafr. 5, pt 7.)

The political elements oi civitas, suffragium and honores, were
forfeited by infamy (infamia) or loss of eivic honour (existi-
matio); and hence arises the question whether infamia is to
be regarded aa a capitis minutio (see, on this subject, Greenidge,
Infamia).

Austin, in leyiug the bases of jurisprudeuce, has referred to the
law of honour to illustrate the differenoe of positive law from all law
not positive; but in Rome the law of honour, aa the law of reli·
gion in most modern states, was partially taken up into positivo
legislation. The public sentimenta oi esteem and disesteem, that is
to say, were armed with politieel sanctiens, and thus certain pro·
ceedings were discouraged which were not otherwise prohibited hy
positive law, and the due application of these sanctiens was the
function of a special organ appointed by the legislator. This
orgen was the censor, who had both a discretionery power of
branding a man with ignominy by an annotation against his
name in the eivio register (notatio, subscriptio censoria), and, as
revisor of the lists oi the senate, the knights, and the tribes,
enforeed the disabilities of infamy by removing the iufamous
person from any of those bodies. As the Comitia Centuriam,
as well as the comitia Tributa, had in later times been eon-
neeted with the division into tribes, the tribeless man (aerarius)
forfeited his vote and became incapable oi military service, Livy,
7, 2. These graver consequences oi infamy were not iu the dis·
eretion of the censor, but governed by strict rules oi consue·
tudinary law (jus moribus introductum). 'Phe law of infamia,
as established hythe censor, cameto be also recognized by the
praetor iu his edict (ci. Dig. 3, 1, l, 8 Qui edicto praetoris ut
infames notantur), who made infamy not only a consequence
of condemnation in any eriminal trial (publicum judicium), but
also oi condemnatiou in certain eivil actions founded on delict,
such as theit, rapine, outrage, fraud; or on certain contraets, such
