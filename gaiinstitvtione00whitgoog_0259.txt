11. §t les-146] Q. Μ. TESTAMENTA INFIRMENTVR 199

(1) The pupillery substitutione, the nature oi which will hereafter
(1 179) 19 explained:

(3) Legaciee given to certain conjunctae personae, e. g. legaoies
to ascendente or descendants oi the testator, 01· a bequest to tbe
wife of the dower which she had brought to her husband. If, in'·
stead oi making the conjuncta persona a legates, the testator hed
given his bounty in the form of a portion oi the inheritence in which
the conjuncte persona was instituted heir, such institution continued
valid. 'ibe validity, however, of such legacies end institutione was
by a constitution oi Antoninus Pius, Dig. 37, δ, 7, and 8 pr. sub·
jected to this limitation, that all the conjunctae personae together
could not taire more than avirilis portio, 1 e. they were not entitled

to more than fell to the lot oi esch contra-tabulant or claimant oi
ζ contre-tabuler possession; with this further proviso, that any oon·
1 juncte persona who is instituted heir of the inheritance in a portion
ᾗ of the heriiege may retain cs much thereof as he would have obtained
¹ by claiming contretabular possession, cf. Roby, vol. 1, p. 250.

4 The partia] intestcey produced by contra-tabular possession shows
ss that the rule which we have already quoted, nemo pro parte testa·

= tus pro perte intestatus decedere potest, must be taken with some
1 reservation. Although a 11111101· cennot voluntarily dispose oi only
2 part of his heritnge, such partia] disposition may be introduced
² against the testator's intention by the operation of law. The signi·
. ficance oi the rule is principally this: that if a testator only
ἶ names sor a certain fraction of the inheritance‚ 01· if the fraction in
which one of several heire is instituted lapsos by his decease before
J the testator's death, the portion which was undisposed oi or lapsed
ξ does not devolve, as it would in English law, 10 the heire-atlaw or
l persons entitled by intestacy, but goes by accrunl (secretio) to those

¹ 10 whom 1119 remainder of the inheritence is leit.
