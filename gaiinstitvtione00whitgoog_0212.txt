152 DE ADQVIRENDO RERVM DOMINIO [11. §hdo-61.

short of quiritary ownership in three respecta, (1) either in respect
oi the persone in whom they resided, (a) or of the objects to
which they related, (3) or of the title by which they were
acquired.

(1) To be capable of quiritary ownership a mon must have one
of the clemente of Roman citizenship. J us quiritium, right
quiritary, sometimes, indeed, denotas all the elements of civitas
Romana, Roman citizenship (1 §t 28, 35, comm). Beneficio princi·
pali Latinus civitatem Romanam accipit si ab imperatore jus
quiritium impetraverit, Ulpian 3, 2. But the only clement of
citizenship required for quiritary ownership was commercium, and
as we have seen that the Latinus possessed commercium with·
out connubium, the Latinus was capable of quiritary dominion.
The alien (peregrinus) on the contrary was incapable, except by
special privileget yet he might have ownership, which he acquired
by titles of jus gentium, eg. tradition, occupation, accession, hc,
and could maintain by a] real ¹action ih the court of the praetor
peregrinus or praeses provinciae.

(a) Provincia] land was not capable of quiritary ownership.
Originally, indeed, private ownership appears to have been confined
to things capable of being taken by the hand (mancipatae), that is
to movables; and lande were only subject to public dominion or
were the common property of the gens. Private ownership, however,
first invaded a portion of the laud, the heredium, or hereditary
homeetead of the gentilis, and finally became a general institution;
and ager publicus, as opposed to ager privatus, almost ceased to
exist on Italian soil. But in the provinces subsequently conquered,
, land continued to the end subject exclusively to publio dominion;
and thus one of the essential features of feudal tenure, the exclusivo
vesting of absolute or ultimate dominion over land in the sovereign
as overlord, a principle commonly supposed to have been first intro·
duced into Europe by the invading German hordes, had already
existed, though in a different form, over by far the greater portion
of the Roman world. It is true that the provinces were divided into
private possessione and public domains; but private possessione as
wellas public domains were subject to a vectigal, and the tonante of
the one and leseees of the other were equally devoid of absolute
ownership. Rights over solum provinciale of amore or less limited
kind were however acquirable, though not by titles of jus civile, and
recoverable by real action, for which Gaius uses the terme possessio
and ususfructus, ξ 7.

(3) Bonitary ownership was distinct both from an alien’s ownership
and from rights over provincial land: it may be defined as the
property ol a Roman citizen in a subject capable of quiritary
