111. p lca] OBLIGATIONES EX DELICTO 403

as a crime. So, again, in later Roman law the same delictal act, e. g.
furtum, might be pursued either as a crime cr as a civil injury.

The following may be taken as a kind of rough classification cf
actions Every right of action arises out ofa violation of some
positive or negative duty.

(ι) A violation of a positive duty to perform or negative duty of
forbearance may be aviolation of a jus in personam, and found an
action for breach cf contract, called an action ex contractu, or may be
the violation cf some right which is regarded as ifit were the breach
of a contract, giving rise to an actio quasi ex contractu.

(a) A violaticn ofa negative duty, that is, duty to abstain, may be
a violaticn of a jus in rem, which, if it is sn offence called delict,
gives rise toan action enforceable by the individual aggrieved, cr
similarly, if the violation is one which, though not strictlya delict,
is treated as if it were so, it gives rise toan actio quasi ex delicto.

(3) Or violatione of duties giving rise to actions and other remediea
which are founded simply 011 the fact of ownership or possession,
such as vindicatio, actio Publiciana, the possessory interdicte.

But there are many miscellaneous actions which cannot be easily
brought under any cf the above heads

Actione ex contractu seek to enforce both the rights immediately
founded on a contract and those created by a party's subsequent
unlawful intention (dolus) or carelessness (culpa) in relation to the
contract.

Real actions and actions ex contractu are simply restitutory in
their object; they imply that a defendant aas something which hs
ought not to have: withholds from the plaiutiff some thing or
service cf pecuniary value to which the plaintiff is entitled. Actione
ex delicto do not necessarily imply that the defendant iras what

he ought not to have; they necessarily impute unlawful conduct
(dolus or culpa) to the defendant, ξ 211, and imply imputability, or

responsibility for such conduct.

In respect of contracta Culpa is distinguished es cf different
degrees; and sometimes a higher, sometimes a lower degree is
capable of generating obligation. In respect of delicta, that is, the
delict of damage tc property, Culpa is not distinguished by grada-
tions; any neglect of ordinary care suffices to generate obligation.

The object of an action ex delicto may be either simply to
recover a penalty (e. g. actio furti), or partly to recover a penalty and
partly to obtain damages (e. g. actio vi bonorum raptorum), or it may
be to obtain personal satisfaction for the injury caused by the offence
(e. g. actio injuriarum); but we shall find that in every case a
delictal action has characteristica, which do not belong to a merely
restorative action. (Of. Inst 4, 6, 17 and 18.) Real actions and
