ξ 16. The specification of the title or ground of claim (expressio
causae) in a real action (secundum suam causam, sicut diri) may have
been, as Bethmann·Hollweg supposes (R. 0. P. l, 139), limited to
actions where the object claimed was a person, and was then designed
to distinguish whether the person was claimedasaon, wife,bondsman
(mancipium), or slave. See l ξ 134, comm. litore probably, however,
it was universally required in statute-process, though not in the for·
mulary system, for the purpose ol ascertaining in all casesthe ground
on which each party claimed, as whether it was on account of a manci·

After completing his account ot Sacramentum, Gaius probably
proceeded to explain the nature of Judicis postulatio in tha 48
lines of the MS„ ,ὁ 17α, which are wanting, though in the latter
part ot them he had gone on to trent ol the condictio. of its process
we have a fragment in the formula derived from Valerius Probus,
the first two letters of which, however, are very doubtful: Te,
Praetor, judicem arbitrumve postulo uti des, ‘I pray you, Praetor,
to appoint an arbiter or judga’ It seems to be distinguished from
actio sacramenti in personam and from condictio not only in respect
of its form, but by the greater freedom allowed to the judex
or arbiter, appointed by the Praetor, at the requeet of one of the
parties, to try the suit. Thus it was apparently the prototypa of
actions bonae fidei, as opposed to actions stricti juris, that is of
actions ior euforcing obligations which might require an equitable
balancing by the judex or arbiter of opposite claime, and an assess-
ment by him ol such damages as good saith required to be paid to the
plaintiff. It would thusbesuitable in cases for which the actio sacra·
menti in personam would supply an insufficient remedy. A party
taking advantage oi this procedure would have to show that his case
cama under the provisions oi the Twelve Tables, or of some other
lex, and that it was suitable to an arbitrium The actions Finium
regundorum, Familiae herciscundae, Aquae pluviae arcendae, de
arboribus succisis, which are mentioned in or derived from the Twelve
Tables, appear to have been tried by an arbiter or arbiters, that is, to
have been forms of J udicis postulatio. For an account oi views of
different writers respecting the origin and nature of judicis postulatio
see Muirhead, Roman Law, ξ 35.

The phrase manum conserere is sometimes used, though not by
Gaius, in reference to the actio sacramenti (Cic. pro Mur. 12, 26 ; Gell.
20, 103 Varro, L. L. 6, 64), meaning, perhaps, the act ol the parties in
laying hold at the same time of the object in disputa or engaging in
aconflict about it. This mimic confliot originally took place on the
