01· by omitting to claim an inheritance, or by making some omission
in procedure. cf. 4§57.

(2) A second condition is some special or abnormal position 01 the
person who claime relief when such special circumstance is the
cause 01 the loss which he has suffered. Thus a minor may be
relieved against 011 injudicious bargain, but not against the casual
destruction 01 the thing'he has purchased, 101 this lose was not
occasioned by his minority or inexperience. Such abnormal
positione (justae causae) are compulsion, fraud, minority, absence,
error.

(3) A third condition 01 relies is the absence 01 various disen-
titling circumstances. Thus relief is granted against the effect
01 legal dispositione and omissione, but not against the effect 01
delicte. Again the extraordinary relief 01 111 integrum restitutio
is not granted when the 000110 01 law can administer an adaquata
remedy.

Originally capitis minutia 01 a defendant was ground for a resti·
tution, 3 §84 ; but thie eeased at an early period to be anything more
than aformal case 01 restitution3 for rescission of the adrogation,
adoption, emancipation, whereby 0 person’s debts were extinguished,
vvas granted aa a matter 01 course without any previous investiga·
tion (causae cognitio), and without any period 01 prescription like that
which limited the right to pray 101 restitution.

This was, originally, annus utilis, and in the time 01 Justinian,
quadriennium continuum or four calendar years, which begin 1011111,
1101110111 the date 01 the Loesion, but 110111 the termination 01 the
Causa, ie the abnormal position-minority, absence, compulsion,
deception, error—whereby the 10001011 was occasioned. Such at
least is Savigny's aad Windsnheid’s opinion. Vangerow holds that,
except in Minority and Absence, prescription begins to run from the
date 01 haesion, 4 ἐξ 110-113, comm.

01 the five titles to restitution that we have enumerated, four,
namely, intimidation, fraud, absence, error, implying equality 01
rights in all parties, belong to the law 01 Things 01 actions, title by
minority, implying a privileged class or inequality 01 rights, belongs
to the law 01 Persona.

As we shall have 0000011011 in the next book, 51140οο11111, to
use the expression Rerum universitas it may seem appropriate,
before we quit the law 01 Persona, to give some explanation 01 the
contrasted term, Personarum universitas A University of persons
in the private code is a fictitious or juristic person, composed
generally by the union 01 0 number 01 individuale, and capable like
a natural individual (singularis persona) 01 the various rights and
duties 01 property, that ia to say, 01 potestas, patronatus, dominium,
