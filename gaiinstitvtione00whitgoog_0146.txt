on pignus and fiducia. Book 3, 11 90, 91, comm. His duty may
have been to ask the witnesses whether they were bearing witness
to the transaction (antestari). cf. Roby, Privata Iaw, pp. 180, m 2,
423, 11. 3.

The vindicta or wand used in manumission, as already stated, was
the rod or verge symbolizing a lance carried by the parties in a real
action, 4 § 13. The status of freedom (libertas) whether as opposed 11
slavery or 1ο bondage (mancipii causa) was 1 real right (jus in rem),

“ and therefore a subject to be contested in a vindicatio. Manumis·

sion by vindicta was 1 collusive vindicatio, in other words, an in
jure cessio. Cf. Roby, l, p. 26, n. l.

The epitome 11 Gaius (l. c.) calls the person, 11 whom theson was
mancipated by pater naturalis, pater fiduciarius, which implica that
the mancipation was accompanied by a fiducia or declaration 11
111111. The trust would be that the pater fiduciarius should make
1111111 or confess in the subsequent injure cessio.

§ 134. Assuming that in adoption, as in emancipation, the person
to whom theson was mancipatcd was called pater fiduciarius, we
find in adoption three fathers. in the field, pater naturalis, pater
fiduciarius, and pater adoptivus Remancipation to the natural
sathsr added a stage to the process; but is described as more con·
venient, because it reduced the number 11111111 from three to two ;
for it enabled the part 11 pater fiduciarius to be played by pater
adoptivus. It appears from § 135 (cf. however§ 141) that though
the status of bondage was purely formal, yet perhaps to give an
air 11 reality to the drama, the status was sometimes made 11
have a certain duration. So when a prinas is advanced 111111 the
rank 11 private to that 11 general, a certain interval is intorposed
between the intermediate promotione 111 the sake of 1111111111,
though, the whole proceeding being nnreal, all the steps, if the
authorities were so disposcd, might be comprsssed into a single day.

'Phe status 11 paterfamilias or of filiusfamilias being, like other
kinds of status, a real right, the 1111111111 person as filiusfamilias
was a matter to he contested in 1 1111 aetion or vindicatio brought
against the person in whose possession he was. This would seem
the more obvious in primitive times, when probably no distinction
was made between patria potestas and dominica potestas, i.e. be-
tween paternal power and absolute proprietorship. Such vindicatio
was sometimes a matter 11 contentione (not voluntary) jurisdiction,
i.e. 11 genuine litigation. 01. Dig. 6. 1, 1, 2, where we ars told that
