THE EDICTA PERPETUA xxxiii
public utility¹.’ The edict of the Praetor Peregrinus was necessarily

; still more of a substitute for the civil law than that ol the Praetor
i Urbanus. For, since the Legis Actiones could not (at least in many

cases) be employed by Peregrini ², he was forced to invent equiva-
lents for these forms of action.

'l'he third Edictum Perpetuam which was valid in Rome was
that of the Oumle Aediles ³. It was oi no great content, since it
was concerned exclusively with the jurisdiction over the market, and
the control of public sites-a jurisdicticn and control which were
possessed by these magistrates. For an edict in any way com·
parable to those of the Praetors we must turn to the provinces.
Here the governors (whether Proconsuls or Propraetors) issued
notices of their intentions with respect to jurisdiction, similar to
those of the Praetors at Rome as regards their permanent character
and the possibility of their transmission, but peculiarly applicabis to
the particular govemor's special sphera of administration. A special
edict was issued for each separate province (thus we read of an
Edictum Siciliensel⁴ 3 but this special character did not prevent
serim inter-relations between the edicts of separate provinces We
know that the Provincial Edict might be prepared at Rome, before
the gevemer went to his province³3 and although the man who pre·
pared it (of course, with the assistance oi professioual lawyers), tried
to model his rules as closely as possible on those of his predecessor
in the province to which he was going, yet he might borrow im·
provements which had been initiated by the late governor of some
other province. Again, the same man might pass from one province
to another, and, much as the circumstances of the separate spheres
of government differed from oue another, it is inconceivable that he
should not have carried some of his favourite rules cf procedure with
him. A general conception of what a Provincial Edict should be
like, must have grown up; the differences between the edicte being
probably those of matter rather than of form-the matter being
determined by the local customary law of the subject peopleS, which
Rome rigidly respected. Where there were striking differences cf
form, these must have been mainly due to the varieties of rights
granted by the Charters of the different provinces (Leges Pro·

vinciarum). It is obvious that, where much was granted by Oharter,
little was left to the discretion of the governor. Where the Oharter
granted only a lew elementary rights, he had a much fraer haud.

the nae of the Iegis Actio. See Girard, Manacl, p. 110.
