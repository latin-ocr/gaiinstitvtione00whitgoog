The rule 01 Paulus would make 0 promise of payment 10 the
promisee and a stranger, 1103, void as 10 the latter, so that the
promisee would only take a moiety, the law being thus stated in
the corresponding passage 01 the Institutas, Inst. 3, 19, 4. But in
a formless contract of sale the Sabinian doctrina still prevailed.

The same rule applied to 1110 passive obligatior a contract imposed:
the debtor created bya contract could not be in the first instance
the heir of the promisor, § 158. 0110 iutelligiblo motiva for pro·
hibiting obligations from taking effect on the death of the promisor
would be 1ο prevent evasione 01 the testamentary lawa restricting
the powers of testation. A testator who wished to leave a legacy
to a person who could not 10110 under a will from want either of
Gapaoitas or of passive Testamentifactio, or a legaey beyond the
amount permitted by the lex Falcidia 01 001110 other law, would
enter into a Stipulation, binding his heir 10 pay a certain sum after
the death of the promisor. The promisee then could recover this
sum not aa legates but as creditor under the stipulation. That such
evasione were in fact attempted appears from Dig. 22, 3, 2⁷. But this
opening of a door to fraudulent evasions is not what Gaius, § 100,
intends 10 express by ‘Inelegance,' which means something not in
accordance or in harmony with legal principle, the principle in this
ease being that a contractis confined in its operation to the parties
1011, and that the heir 0011 only be entitled 10 the rights and liable
101110 obligations 01 the deceased by way of succession. J ustinian,
however, abolished the distinctions recorded in· this paragraph, and
allowed 1110 stipulation of an 001 10 110 performed either for the heir
of the promisee, 01 by the heir 01 the promisor, Inst. 3, 19, 13.

case is 1101 void, but good for the smaller amount. The Institutas 01
Justinian (3, 19, 5), 011 the other hand, adopt the view 01 tha law
taken by Gaius, perhaps inadvertently.)

A slave or filiusfamilias who stipulated a payment 10 himself
acquired a right 101 1110 master or paterfamilias. Except 111 these
relations, it was the rulo that aman could not stipulata for a third
person. Payment, however, 10 0 third party might be stipulated for,
so as to eutitle the third party to receive it, Inst. 3, 19, 4, and such
payment might be secured by a penal clause, stipulating, in default
01 performance, payment of a penal sum to the promisee, Inst l. c. 19.
