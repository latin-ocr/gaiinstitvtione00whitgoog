and ceasing to belong to a given group of agnatos constituted
capitis minutio, and was its definition, than the vestal virgin must
inevitably have suffered cepitis minutio; the fect thut she did not
in spite of leaving her family and snapping the agnatio tie, is at
once conceivable, on the supposition that thare is no capitis minutio
without degradation.

Unless capitis minutio minima involved a downward step on tha
stair of status, ithae no analogy ta tha other forms of capitis
minutio, auditis not obvious why it should heve the same generis
appellation, or why it should be handled in ‚the same department of
the code. The rupture of the ties of agnatiou, extinguishing rights
of intestata succession, might be a loss, but it was not a loss fram
inferiority of privilaga; it was a loss of an aquai among =equals3 it
was mona like the loss of dos which a husband might incur by¹
divorce of his wife, or an heir by neglecting ta accept a succession
within the appointed period (oratio), 2 § 1643 neither of which persons

On the whole, then, Savigny seems justified in considering the
definition given by Paulus and his statement respecting the children
of adrogatus as inexact Paulus himself, in speaking of emancipa-
tion, implies the true conditione of eapitis minutio: Dig. 4, ⁵, 3

Although rupture of thetios, and forfaiture of the rights, or
release from tha dutiae, of agnation, were not the essenos of capitis
minutio minima, yet they were among its principal consequenoes.
The capite minutus lost his claim as suus heres at civil law, that is,
his right to succeed to an intestata ascendant, or to be instituted
heir in his will or formally disinherited. These effecte of capitis
minutio were, however, oounteracted to some extent by jus prae
tarium or the legislation of the praetor (bonorum possessio unde
Iiberiz aud contra tabulas). He also lost his right as legitimus
heres at civil law, that is, his right to succeed as nearest agnete to
an intestata collateral; and here tha praetor only so far interposed
to assist tha capite minutus, as, iu default of all persons entitled
as nearest muetos, to call him to tha succession in the inferior order

heir was called legitimus heres (statutory heir) because his title was
founded on the statutas of the Twelve Tables, which, in default of

Subsequent statutas created certain quasi agnatesfor persons entitled
