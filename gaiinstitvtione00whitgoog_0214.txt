ἐξ 52-60. An heres was either voluntarius, empowered to accept
or reject the inheritance, or necessarius, heir as matter of course,
without any such power of election. A voluntary heir was either
an agnato entitled to succeed an intestato, or any heir, not being
a suus or necessarius heres of the testator, entitled under a will. A
necessary heir was either a slave oi the testator manumitted by his
will, or a sslf-successor (suus heres), that is, adescendant under power
of the testator or intestata, made independent by his death, ξ 152. In
every case of voluntarius heres, so long as the heir had not entered
on the inheritancs, any stranger was permitted to seire parts of it
and acquire property therein by usucapion. The only title (eausa,
titulus) required for this acquisition was the overture or deletion of the
inheritancetoheresandvacancyof possession. Thispossession,which
Gaius (§ 52) calls pro herede (see Dig. ὅ, 3, 9) is more properly called
pro possessore. cf. 4 § 144. ‘Possessor, as possessor, isthe occupant,
who, ashed why he possessas, answers, “Because 1 possess,’' and
does not claim to be heir even mendaciously, and has no title of
possession to allege.' But according to early Roman law any person
who was allowed by the voluntary heir to romain in possession of
the inheritance lor a year was considered lawfully entitled to it as
heir, bona fides on the part of a possessor being at this time im·
material for the purpose of acquiring by usucapion (hluirhead
Roman Law, ξ 32). 'Phe senatusconsultum of Hadrian, referred to
in the text, W, did not prevent the usucapion, but made it nugatory
byallowingthe hairto recover the hereditaments by real action
(hereditatis petitio, or the interdict Quorum bonorum, 4 ξ 144), just
as if the usucapion had never been completed.

Though the occupant oi the vacant hereditament was called
praedo, bis possession, being encouraged by the lawgiver, was not
unlawful until restitution was claimed, Savigny, ξ 264. This pos·
session is probably the koy to an enigmatical rule in Roman law:
ipsum sibi causam possessionis mutare non posse, Dig. 41, 3, 33, 1;
causam possessionis neminem sibi mutare posse, Dig. 41, 5, 2, 1.
‘No man can change at pleasurs his title of possessiom’ With the
intention, it may be, ol limiting the operation of possessio pro
herede, an anomalous institution of questionable expediency, the rule
declares that a person who commences his possession ola thing
in the character ol a vendee from a nod-proprietor, or holds it as
lessee, borrower, depositary, shall not be able, on the death of the
truc proprietor, to accelerate or initiate muoapion by merely pro·
