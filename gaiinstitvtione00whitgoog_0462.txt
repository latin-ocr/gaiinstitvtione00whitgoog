All actions suppose the violation of some right, but they are not
necessarily founded on a wrong or delict. Thus a possessor of
another man’s property, though no wrong be imputabis to him, is
subject to vindicatio. Actione on contract, however, suppose a
wrong, namely, a wrongful act or omission constituting a breach of
contract, but the plaintiff reserere damages with the object merely of
putting him in the same position as if the contract had been fulfilled.
Delict (delictum, maleficium), on the other hand,is generally used
in a limited sense, to signify any wrong or unlawful act in itself,
such as theft or assauIt, regarded as specially injurious spart from
the loss which it causes. In early law indeed the default ofs debtor
is treated as if it were a delict, but in later times the acts which the
law designatas as delicis involve a violation not of ajus in personam
or right available against a determinate person, but of a jus in ram
or right available against all the world, such acts as are considered
especially injurious to the individual or to the community.

Delicts or wrongs came to be divided into public and private
Public wrongs are those delicte called crimes, private wrongs ane
those delicte which in early times were left to privata vengeance, for
which an action brought by the injured party against the wrougdoer
was afterwards substituted. Injuries, which in modern law are
punished exclusively as crimes, could throughout tha history ef
Roman law be vindicated by the injured party as private wrongs.
Orimes have been defined to be such unlawful acts as are injurious in
the first instance to the State3 civil injurios, such as are harmful,
principallyor exclusively, to private individuale But this definitior
is not satisfactory, because all or most crimes are injurious to private
individuale, and all or most civil injurios are harmful to the com·
munity. A better definitionis the following: Grimes are those
unlawful acts which the state itself visits with punishment. consider
ing them to be specially iujurious to its iuterests3 private delicts ara
unlewful acts or offences which the injured party may himself vindi·
cate by action. The same unlawful act which in one stage of society
is pursued as a private delict may, at a subsequent stage, be punished
