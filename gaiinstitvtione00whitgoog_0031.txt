For the future the progress of law was to depend on the two
prooesses of legislation and interpretation. The legislative assemblies
were those of the Populus and the Plebs. The Populus, which
compr-ised the whole of the Roman people, Patricians as well as
Plebeians, met, either by centurias, as the Comitia Oenturiaa, or
hy tribes, as the Comitia Tributa, under the presidenoy of a Consul
or Praetor.

The Comitia Centuriata was an assembly that had grown out of the
armyorganization oi the whole Roman people. It was the whole
Host or Exercitus expressing its political will. It was for this
reason that the military unit (the centuria) was the voting unit.
And this was also the original reason why we find in this assembly
the division into classes, or aggregatas of citizens grouped together
on thebaeis ofa particular property qualification ; for the different
types oi military service were originally determined by degrees of
wealth. But the alemant oi wealth in this assembly, which is
exhibited by the division into classes, soon gained a political
significanda. The voting power oi the classes differed considerably.
Thet of the wealthy was greater than that of the middleclass,
and that of the middleclass iar in exaesa oi that of the poor. Thus
the Comitia centuriata was always assumed to have something of an
aristocratio character; and the change which its constitution under-
went during the Republio was at least partly directed by an effert to
modify this ahmater. The scheme recognized five classes, the
census of each being (in terms of the later assesement of the
bisarion period) respectively 1oo,ooo‚ raeco, socco, aenou, and
11‚000 (or 12‚500) esses. uhe first class contained eighty centurias,
lhe second, third, and fourth, twenty each ; the fifth, thirty. Thus the
centurias of the first-class were almost equal to those of the four other
clames put together. The weight of aristocratia influence may be
still more fully realized if we remember that the corps oi Roman
Knights (centuriae equitum equo publico) formed eighteen centurias
in this assembly, and that the mass oi citizens whose property fell
below the minimum census were grouped in a single century. The
collective vote of the first class and the knights was represented by
ninetyeight centurias 3 the collective vote of the whole of the rest oi
the eommunity (including four or five centuries of certain professional
wrpomtions connected with the army, such as the Fabri) was
