and such a slave is one of the things respecting which you agreed
with the plaintiff that whatever was inducted, illated, imported .
into such and such land, 04 was thereon born cr produced, should
be pledged to the plaintiff 10 secure the payment of the rent 01

of 40110 Hypotheoaria to interdictum Salvianum would resemble that

Inuominate or unnamed contract is an agreement not falling
under any 01 1140 classes of named 00414401, which becomes binding
by execution on the part 01 one of the contractors. Such contracte,
which are 01 4 miscellaneous character, are similar to the real in the
principle 01 114014 formation, but differ from them in tho ways we
have previously pointed out Bilateral conventione, Real or Gon-
sensual, fall into four classes: Aut enim do tibi ut des, aut do ut
140144, 441 14010 41 des, aut 14010 41 140144, Dig. 19, 5, 5, pr. ‘There
may be a transfer of property 10 you cn my part in consideration of
your having 10 transfer property to me in erchange, 04 1444410401
property on my part in consideration of your having to make some
other kind of performance to me, or some other act of performance
iu consideration 01 your having 10 transfer something to me, or
performance 01 some other kind than transfer in consideration 01
your having to make performance 01 40440 44014 011404 kind in
erchange’ Some agreements, before execution on either side, would
give rise to Named consensual contracte, sale, letting, partnership,
04 mandate ς and these would be at once enfomeable by action: while
those agreements unaccompanied by execution, whose nature ex·
cluded them from these appellatione, would have no legul validity.
These agreements which to consensus add execution, but fail to
satisfy 1144 definitione of the Named Real 0041440144, are thrown into
the miscellaneous class called Innomiuate. We have thus the follow·
