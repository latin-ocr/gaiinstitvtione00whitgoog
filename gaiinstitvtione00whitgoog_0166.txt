Twelve Tables devolved on the gans it may be inferred bytho
reasoning adopted in § 165 that the guardianship passed 1011 also.

§ 167. It seems anomalous that a Latin, ic. a concivis, should
have been a subject 01 wardship: 101 as tutela is an institute 01 jus
civile (51 142, comm„ 189), i. e. jus civium, we should have expected
thet, asin the ease 01 patria potestas, both pater and filius must be
cives Romani, § 128, so hero both parties, the werd as well as the
· guardian, must 01 necessity be cives Romani. The anomaly, how·
ever, was expressly enacted by the lex J unia: which further departed
from the law 01 the Twelve Tables by separating the guardianship
from the right of succession3 ferit gave the guardianship to the
person who before the manumission had been quiritary owner, but
the right 01 succession 10 the person who had previously been
bonitary owner. Latinus was not only capable of being a ward,
but also 01 being a guardian, Fragmenta Vaticana, 1933 that is,
though he was incapable 01 being a testamentary guardian, ξ 23,
he could, it would seem, be mede a tutor dativus, that is, appointed
by a magistrate, 1 185.

§ 168. In later Roman law, when the interest 01 the ward and not
that 01 the agnates was principally regarded, guardianship became
inalienable. Similarly in English jurisprudence guardianship is
said not 10 be capable 01 assignment or transfer, 1100111100 11 is not
a right but a duty.
