ξ 45. cf. ξ 34, comm. Iu an action with a formula in factum con·
cepta, the Intentio, si paret iecisse, ‘If it appear that the defendant
has done this or ther-⁴ Il the defendente aot place him in a certain
class,’ corresponds to the minor promise of a syllogism of which the
conclusion isa ‘'l'hen this defendant is under euch and such an
obligation to this plaintiff,' or ‘This defendant is condemnable to
vperform such and such aservice to thie plaintiffi’ The major promise
will be: ‘All persons who have done such and euch an act,’ or, ‘who
belong to such and such a class, a1e under such and euch an
obligetiou’ or ‘are compellable to render such and euch aservico
to such and euch a plaintiffi’ This major promise ie withdrawn from
discussion, is not permit-ted to be disputed; and the issue in such
an action can only relate to the minor premiss; in other words, is
always an issue of fact.

ln an aetio with a formula in jus concepta, the intentio, Si paret
oportere, ‘Il it appear that the defendentis under such and such
an obligation,’ corresponds to the conclusion of a syllogiem ol which
the minor premiss is: ‘The defendant belongs to such aud sucha
elaea? and the major: ‘All persons belonging to such and such
a class are under euch and such an obligation' The major premiss
may be sn alleged rule either of law or of equity, a proposition
either of civll law or of praetorian law; and in neither case is it with·
drawn from discussion. The issue that is to say, in an action with
a formula injus concepta may either relate to the minor or to the
major premiss: may be either an issue of fact or an issue of law.

The following passage of Cicero speaks oi actions whose formula
was in jus concepta with the additional terme, ex fide bona or the
like ς and thus making itan actio bonae fidei. Privata enim judicia
maximarum quidem rerum in juris consultorum mihi videntur esse
prudentia. . . . In omnibus igitur iis judiciis in quibus ux nms sors
