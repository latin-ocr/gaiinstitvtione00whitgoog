unless Litis contestatio took· place within thirty years from the

nativity of an action; so, after Litie contestatio, an interval 01
thirty years after any act of the judge or 0110 01 the parties should
be a bar to any further prosecution of the action. J ustinian limited
the duration of civil suits to three years from litis contestatio,
and sanctioned the law against a party who failed to proceed 111 the
action after being ordered 10 do so by contumacia] proceedings
(eremodicium, ἔρημος δίκη) against the contumacious plaintiff 01
defendant, God. 3, 1, 13; if both parties agreed to let the litigation
lie dormant, he limited the dormancy 01 pendency to forty years.
BethmannHollweg, 5117.

The expiration of the commission of the judex by the expiration
of the iunctions of the praetor who appointed him suggests an
analogy to the common Law previous to 1 Geo. 3, c 2³3 by which act
judges are continued in their offioes notwithstanding any demise of
the crown, which was formerly held 1ο vacate their seats

’1110 division of actions into those with a pendency⁷ 01 eighteen
months (judicia legitima) and those which expire with the praetor-
ship (judicia impen‘o continentia) is not coincident with the division
into those which are ipso jure extinctive 0111111110 litigetion and
those which are merely counteractive ope exceptionis,§ 106. For
although all judicia imperio continentia, whether in jue or in
factum, are merely liable to be met by an exception, some judicia
legitima, i. e. real actions sud actiones honorariae, are not ipso jure
extinctive,§ 107. (laius, therefore, would have been guilty of an
inaccuraoy if, 811180, 181, he meant to identify the two divisione,
but when he says, le. ξ 181, ‘si legitimo judicio debitum petiero,
postea de eo ipso jure agere non possim: he seems only tabe speaking
of an actio stricti juris for the recovery of a debt, aad not to refer
in any way to actiones in rem or actiones honorariae.

The reason why real actions and actions in factum had not the
same power of Novation ae personal actions in jus was probably
as follows: Under the legis actiones the same claim could not be the
subject of a second trial, being ipso jure consumed or extinguished
by having been once sued on ; 5 108. Nam qua dere actum semel
erat, de ea postea ipso jure agi non poterat: neo omnino ita, ut nunc,
usus erat illis temporibus exceptionum. After the lex Aebutia,
which instituted the formulary procedure, an action in personam
with an intentio injus concepta, 0. g. si paret Numerium Negidium
Aulo Agerio x He. dare oportere, an action 011 which the parties
had joined issue was consumed ipso jure in the sama way as
actions under the older procedure, provided it was ajudioium legiti-
mum, ie. instituted between Roman citizens before a single judex,

aad within an area bounded by the first mileetone. Proceedings
