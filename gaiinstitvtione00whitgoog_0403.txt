111. §ear-109] DE INVTILIBVS STIPVLATIONIBVS 343

quite certain that the refusal 10 perform the act would have caused
him to deprive the person to whom the bequest is given of his
liberality. At 011 events, this person is himself innocent of un-
lawful intention, end the same cannot be said of the contractor who
. is guilty oi 011 agreement to violate the law. Accordingly, the law
aids the one but 1101 the other; and the rule, once established for
immoral conditione, was extended 10 impossible conditione

On this point the 11011011 code agrees with the Roman law. In
1110 Austrian code the Proculian doctrine is followed: i. s. testa·
mentary dispositione as well as contracta are invalidated by im·
moral 01 impossible conditione. The Prussian code, till it was
superseded by the German civil code, followed a middle course:
impossible conditione invalidated a testamentary disposition3 irn-
moral conditions were deemsd unwritten and the disposition con·
strued as unconditional. The German civil code does not lay down
any special rules as to the effect of impossible or immoral conditione
attached to testamentary dispositione, treating testamentary dis·
positione in the same way in this respect as other dispositions.
A disposition to which an immoral or unlawful disposition is
attached is void, whether it 10 0 condition precedent 01 sub·
sequent. A disposition to which an impossible condition precedent
is attached is void: a disposition to which an impossible condition
subsequent is attached is looked upon as if no condition were
attached to it.

A Condition was not annexablc 10 all dispositione. It was an·
nexable to all Testamentary dispositione: but among formal dis·
positione inter vivos the only ones 10 which it could bo annexed
were Stipulationa A condition could 1101 10 annexed toan In
jure cessio or surrender before the magistrate: Nulla legis actio
proditasst defuturo, Frag. vat. 49. Nor to Mancipatio, nor to
Acceptilatio, nor to Expensilatio (Literal Obligation), nor 10 Cog-
nitoris datio. Sub conditione cognitor non recte datur, non magis
quam mancipatur, aut acceptum 101 expensum fertur, Frag. Vct. 329.
Nor could it be annexed to magisterial Tutoris datio: Sub con·
ditione a praesidibus provinciarum· non posse dari tutorem placet,
et si datus sit nullius esse momenti dationem, Dig. 26, 1, 6, 1: 1101
10 Tutoris auctoritas, Dig. 26, 8, 8: 110110 hereditatis aditio, nor
10 servi optio: Actus legitimi qui 11011 recipiunt diem vel condi·
tionem, veluti mancipatio, acceptilatio, hereditatis aditio, servi
optio, datio tutoris, in totum vitiantur per temporis vel conditionis
adjectionem, Dig. 50, 17, 77.

Later jurisprudence admitted the annexation of conditione to
the alienation oi property by means of Tradition. Conditions arc
Suspensirc or Resolutive. Tradition coupled with a suspensive
