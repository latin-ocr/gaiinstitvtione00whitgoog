xii HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION

between the years 212 and 217 nn, really eliminated all the local
varieties of customary law. Local customs tend to die hard, and it
was never in the spirit of the Roman Empire to suppress them. The
legal unity of the Empire was always more strongly marked in the
matter of Procedure than in the matter of substantive Law. The
processes of the Gourts were the same for every Province at a time
when the greatest varieties of customary law were recognized by
these courts.

We may now attempt to treet in greater detail the stages ol Roman
Legal History which we have outlined. The earliest stage—that
marked by the independent or almost independent life of the Glan
or Gens-is one ior which, bytho nature of the case, no definite
historical evidence existe. The reality of such a life ie merely an
inference drawn from the characteristics oi the Gens as it appears
before us in the historicsl period. These characteristics seem to
prove that the Gens is not ereally primitive institution, but elate
and advenced stage in the social development of the Latin races ; but,
on the other hand, they may show thet it was in many respects a
more primitive unit than the State ; thetis, that it exercised rights
and duties which were ultimately exercised by the State. No
political society worthy of the name can deal with Clans as the
subjecte ol rights; it can deal only with Families or Individusls.
Hence, if the Roman Gens ever lived a strong corporate lue, the
authority oi the Roman State must in those days have been weak.

The organization ol the Gens was based on the patriarcha] idea in
its extreme form ; that is, on the conception that relationship is only
binding when it can be traced through the male line. And this is
the fact which seems to prove that the Gens marks e late and
mature stage in the development oi Latin societies; for the patri·
archel idea is not one thetis readily grasped by the mind oi primitive
man. Yet, late as the Gens is when considered in reference to the
prehistoric development oi the Latin race, it perhaps possessed, before
the very dawn of history, a unity and power oi its own, of which
but pale reflectione survive in the historica] period. In historical
times the only test ol unity was the common name borne by the
Gentiles ¹ ; the chief signs of corporate action were their guardianship

of the insane and their reversionary right oi guardianship over
women and children2—powers which the Gentiles must have
