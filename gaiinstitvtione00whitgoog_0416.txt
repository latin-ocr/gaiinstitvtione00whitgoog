regressus, Another important characteristic of a Correal obligation
is that formal discharge (acceptilatio) by one of the Correal creditore
entirely extinguishes the Oorreal debt so that none of the other
Oorrei can sue for· it. Oi. ξ 215. (On the subject of (torreality and
Solidarity and ior an account of the literature relating to these joint
and several forms oi obligation, see Sohm, ξ 74.)

After this preliminary consideration oi the nature oi Correality
we are in a position to examine the nature oi Guaranty or Surety-
ship, and tc fix the relation of fidejussio, one oi the latest develop-
ments ol Suretyship, to other cognate institutione oi Roman
jurisprudence.

Fidejussio is a species cf Iaaaaoass103 and accordingly the above·
mentioned object requires us to examine the nature and subdivisione
of Intercessio.

Intercession is the assumption of liability for the debt ol another
person by contract with his creditor. For instance, when a person
is hesitating whether he shall accept an inheritance because he has
doubts whether it is solvent, that is, whether the assets exceed the
liabilities, to induce him to accept it hya general promise of indemni·
ficationis not Intercession, because here there is no contract with
a creditor on account of a debt owed to him by a third party: but if
the ground oi his hesitation is a suspicion that the debtors to the
inheritance are insolvent, to induce him to accept the inheritance by
a promise to make good what he fails to recover from the debtors is
Intercession, for here is a contract with a creditor on account of the
debt oia third party.

Intercession is either (A) Privative or (B) Cumulative.

A„ Privative Intercession is the substitution oi one obligatiou
for another.

(ι) Substitution ior an actually pre-existent debt involves Novamon,
ie. the extinction of such preceding debt, and is generally called by
civilians Exrnourasro, though the term is not merely used in our
sources inthis restricted sense. caltoby, 2, p. 49, n. 1. Expromission,
the discharge oi a debtor by taking his place in relation to the creditor,
may be considered as including Defensio, the defence oi an absent
debtor in a suit instituted by the creditor; for then the volunteer de·
fendant becomes liable to condemnation in place of the original debtor:
Suscipit enim in se alienam obligationem, quippe cum ex hac rc subeat
condemnationem, Dig. 16, 1, 2, 5, Ad senatusconsultum Velleianum.

(a) Substitution, not for an actually pre-existent obligation which
is novated, but ior an obligation which would have to be incurred by
another person ir the present obligation were not assumed, is called
Inrnavnnrro. Si, quum essem tecum contracturus, mulier intervenerit
ut cum ipsa potius contraham, videtur intercessisse, Dig. 16, 1, 8, 14.
