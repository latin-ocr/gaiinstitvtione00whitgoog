to srrcceed in the some order as if they were agnatos, who hence
were eleo called legitimi heredes; e. g. children entitled to succeed to
an intestete mother under the Sc. Orphitianum, end mothers entitled
to suoceed to intestato children under the Sc. Tertullianum. The
effect of capitis minutio in extmguishing title to succeed was confined
to legitimus heroe created by the Twelve Tables, and did not extend
to the legit-imus heres created by these subsequent statutos
Resides the effecta oi cepitis minutio which followed logically
from its consisting in a degradation or fell in status, ond from its
involving eliminetion from a given family or a certain circle of
agneten, it had certain other abnormul or arbitrcry consequenoes-
consequences, that is, which may have once been explicable on
known maxims of the civil law, but which are now inexplicable,
whose rationale had perhaps been lost even in the classical period,
“ ⁸ and is certainly now past conjecture. Such is the rulo, that cupitis
minutio minima of an independent person extinguished the debis oi
cupite minutus. It is true that the injustice opereted by this rulo
of civil lew in the case of adrogatio was counieracted by the inter·
position of the praetor, but, aa at civil law filiusfamilias, though
ζ incapeble of rights, wea capable oi obligations, it ie not obvious why
³ even at civil low a mun’s debts should heve been cancelled by his
degradation from the statua oi paterfamilias to thot ol filiusfamilias.
