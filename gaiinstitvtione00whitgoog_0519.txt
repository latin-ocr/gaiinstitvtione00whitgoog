§510-17. The discovery of the MS. of Gaius by Niebuhr threw
a flood of light on the history of Roman civil Procedure, and not
least on the early process by legis actio. Although the forms of
legis actio had only an historical interest at the time when Gaius
wrote, hs begine his account of procedure by noticing them, because,
as he tells us, ι 10, the actions which were then in use had been to
some extent founded on them. (For the literature concerning the
legis actiones see Muirhead, § 13.)

Τιο term legis actio is correlative ιο lege agere, and thus means
action determined by lex, ie. the Twelve Tables and other leges,§ ll,
agere signiFying the observance oi the formal aeta prescribed by
law ior prosecuting legal claime. (of. Nettleship, Oontr. ιο Latin
Lexioog, s v. actio.) The legis actiones were either legal forms pre
paratory ιο bringing a case ιο trial, or prescribed forme for obtaining
execution, rather than actions in the strict sense. Το ιιο first class
belong the actio sacramenti, per judicis postulationem, and percondic·
tionem3tothe latter per manus injectionem and per pignoris cepionem.
The deposit oi a sacramentum by the two parties ιο a disputato
bring the matter ιο an issue was the basis of what seems ιο ιο
the earliest legis actio. In eontrast with the other legis actiones the
actio sacramenti was a general one, § 13, de quibus enim rebus ut
aliter ageretur lege cautum non erat, de his sacramento ageretur.

The forme of action per judicis postulationem and per condictionem
seem to have been introduced subsequently with a more limited
object. Thus the legis actio sacramenti is both in rem and in
personam. But oi the procedure in personam we have no information
on account of the lacuna in the MS. ξ 15, which can only be filled up
in a general sense. Instead of the assertion ol ownerehip, as in
vindicatio, the creditor would claim from the debtor his debt-aio te
mihi x milia aeris dare oportere. Instead oi a contra-vindicatio
there would be a denial on the part of the debtor ol the obligatior,
and on this denisi the summa sacramenti would be stahed in a
manner conssponding to that which was followed in the actio in
rem. The proceedinge would be simpler and less archaia in character
than in the real aetion. whether, as has been suggested, ure actio
sacramenti was at first always a claim to a thing, which in the case
ol a debt would be the body of the debtor, we do not know, but
the conception of obligation is so rudimentary in early times, as
ιο make it ιιοι improbable. (uf. Brinz, Grunhut'e Zeitschr. 1, 23;
Muirhead, ι 34.)
