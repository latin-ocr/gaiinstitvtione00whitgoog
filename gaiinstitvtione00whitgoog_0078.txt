intrusion oia portion of the public code inte the private code, or,
in barbarous and semicivilized legislatione, the distigurement of
private law by the introduction of relations that properly belong
to public law. For instance, the most salient institution of the
ancient Roman law of Persons, the power of life and death over
wife and child that vested in the father of the household, was the
concession to a subject oi an attribute that properly belongs to
the sovereign ora public iunctionary. Another institution, slavery,
placed one subject over another in the position of despotia sovereign.
The relation of civis to peregrinus may be conjectured to have
originally beent that of patronus to cliens, that rs to say, oi political
superior to politioal inferior.

Government or posit ive law has usually commenced 111 the mva·
sion by the strongerof the (moral) rights oi the weaker; but so
necessary is inequality to equality, or subordination to coordination,
that the (moral) crimes of ancient conquerere are regarded with
less aversion by philosophie historicae, as being the indispensable
antecedente of subsequent civilization. The beginnings, then, of
positive law have been universally the less legitimate form of in·
equality, inequality between subject and subject, leaving its traces
in dispositione of the civil code: but the advance of civilization is
the gradual elimination of inequality from the law, until little
remeius but that between magistrate and private person, or sove-
reign and subject. Modern society has advanced so far on the path
oi equalization, in the recognition of all men as equal before the
law, that the distinctions of status, as they existed in the Roman law
of persons, are almost obliterated from the private code. Slavery
has vanished3 parental and marital power are of the mildest form3
civilized countries accord the same rights to cives and peregrini;
guardians (tutores) in modern jurisprudence, as in the later period
of Roman law, are considered as discharging a public function, and
accordingly the relation of guardian and ward may be regarded as
a portion of the public code.

Before we terminate our general remarks en the‘ nature of status,
it is necessary to distinguish from the law of Persona a department
of law with which, in consequence of a verbal ambiguity, it is some·
times confounded. Blackstone deserves credit for having recognized
Public law as part of the law of Persons; but he also included under
the law of Persons that department of primary rights to which
belong the right of free locomotion, the right of using the bodily
organs, the right to health, the right to reputation, and other rights
which perhaps more commonly emerge in the redress meted out for
their violation, that is, in the corresponding sanctioning rights, the
right of redress for bodily violence, for false imprisonment, for bodily
