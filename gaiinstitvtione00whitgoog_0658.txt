'si nihil usucaptum forct' are a trace of the Sc. mentioned in 2 ξ 57
(cf. comm. to this passage), which relieved the grantes of pouession y

against usucapion, i. e. which rescinded the usucapion, and allowed
Quorum bonorum to be brought even after usucapion had been com·
pleted and the bonafide putative successor or tha mala fide unentitled

occupant no longer possessed pro herede or pro possessore, but pro ῑ

suo. (According to Puchia usucapion was always unavailing against
Quorum bonorum, and the effect of the Scwas only to essist the hair
at civil law, by inserting in the formula of Hereditatis petitio a clause
that had always asa matter of course been inserted in the interdict
Quorum bonorum.)

According, then, to Savigny, Quorum bonorum was adelinitive suit
in matters of succeseion when the plaintiff, instead of claiming here
ditas in reliance cnjus civile, claimed bonorum possessio in reliano
on jus praetorium. But the prevalent opinion is that of Vangerov,

ultimate title to the estate would be determined by an hereditah's
petitio if the suit was brought by the heir, or by an hereditat'u
petitio possessoris, if the suit was brought by the praetoriae
successor, Dig. ὅ, 5, 1. In support of this view, it may be observed
that on Savigny’s hypothesis no satisfactory account can be given of
the nature of hereditatis petitio possessoris

ξ 148. In the real actions of statuteprocess or the oldest system
the award of provisional possession during the pendenoy of a suit
was called Vindioias dicere, cf. § 16 and Gellius 20, 10. In thelater
methods of real action, vindicatio per sponsionem or per formulam
petitoriam, Vindioias dicendae was apparently superseded by ue
interdicte Utrubi and Uti possidetis; which, accordingly, would bear
the same relation to vindicatio that Quorum bonorum bercto
hereditatis petitio.

As these interdicta were required to determine the question who
should have possession pending the vindicatio, so it is clear ua
a third anterior proceeding would be necessary to determine who
should have provisional possession during the pendcncy of litigation
on the interdict: and similarly we might imagines fourth, a ΕΜ
and in fact an infinite series of anterior proceedings to be required.
We shall find, however, that this regressus ad infinitum was stoppod
at the third term by means of an auction (fructus licitatio), ὁ 106,
a process of a very summary character. Ifa party attempted to
defeat this provision by refusing to take part in the auction, his
opponent was aided by interdicta &condaris ξ 170. It may seem
that opposition to the issue 'of interdicta Secundaria would again
