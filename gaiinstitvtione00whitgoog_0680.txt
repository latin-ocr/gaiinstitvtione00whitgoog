the Original writ was a mandate addressed by the head of adminis
tration or judicature to the sheriff 3 that is, to an executive officer,
not, aa the interdict‚ to the individual enitor. Resides, thia mandate
of the crown required the sheriff tc command a defendant to obey
the crown by obeying the precepta of the legislator: the peculiarity
ol the interdict, ae appears from the preceding account of its character,
was that it formed of itself the whole of the law which the suitor
was commanded to obey. 'Phe possessory interdicta, for instance,
simple and meagre aa they outwardly seemed, really comprised
the whole law that governed the protection of mere Possession.
And the same is true of all the other interdicta which have been
enumerated, so that the interdicte had the effect of giving protectior
to rights outslde the ordinary law, through the direct interposition
of the magistrate. This, as already observed, is apparently the true
interpretationes the terma in which Gaius expresses the distinctive
feature ol Interdicts: certis ex causis Praetor aut Proconaul emacr-
ramran auctoritatem suam finiendis controversiis interponit, ξ 139:
ie. in iesuing an interdict the magistrate exereised a principalis
auctoritas, wielded a sovereign authority.

But though originally the subjecte ol the Interdict had been
omitted by the ordinary law, as matters rather of administration
than of legislation; yet after many individual Interdicts had been
issued, and their conditione had been generalized bytho authorities
of jurisprudence; after, moreover, the rulea which would be obser-ved
in their issue had been announeed by the magistrate in his annrral
proclamation3 the arsa ol questions decided by Interdict was
practically as much subject to law aa any other department ol
Roman life. 'Phe code of rulee promulgated by the magistrate (jus
praetorium), being accepted by the state, was just as much law as
if it had been enacted by the legislative assemblies: so that finally
Interdict procedure differed from ordinary litigation merely by
a fringe of form, that served as a memento of its historic origin, the
extraordinary power of the magistrate in republican Rome: this
fringe of form diesppeered with the formulary process, the procedure
in the domain once managed by Interdict being assimilated to the
procedure employed in all the other departmenta of the code; thus
Justinian finde it unnecessary to speak in his Institutes of the old
forms of Interdict procedure. Inst 4, 15, 8.
