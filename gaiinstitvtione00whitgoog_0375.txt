111. §b 88, 89.] OBLIGATIONVM DIVISIO 315

reasons are not given by Gaius, and perhaps we must now be content
to τομαὶ these distinctions as merely positive aud inexplicable rules.
Perhaps, as Ihering suggests, it was held, that to permit an heir
appointed by will to part with the inheritance-in other words, to
convert it into money—would have been in direct opposition to the
testator's intention; who, if he approved oi such a step, might have
adopted the mode oi testation explained in 2 5 189, comm, i.e might
have instituted not the beneficiary bathis slave.

successio per universitatem, as already mentioned, was an insti·
tution only recognized by the legislator in a limited number of cases:
one individual could not make another as he chose, in pursuance of
private disposition, his universal successor. In respect of the
voluntary transfer, inter vivos, oi an inheritance, universal succes·
sion was only admitted in two cases: transfer by an agnate of delata
hereditas (of his right to acquire an intestate succession) in the
interval between delatio and aditio, and transfer (restitutio) by an
heir to a fideicommissario hereditas under the se. Trebellianum,
2 ἕξ 246, 259, comm.

'Phe sale cf an inheritance after acceptance was carried cut in later
law not by in jure cessio, but informally by emptio venditio accom-
panied with tradition and stipulatione or cession ci actions respecting
the debts to or from the inheritance, 2 ξ 252; cf. Roby, 2, p. 162.

Having examined Unequal primary real rights (status) and a
portion oi Equal pn'mary real rights, namely, ownership and servi·
tudes (jura in re), and omitting the detailed examination of another
portion of Equal primary real rights, namely, Primordial rights, we
quit the subject oi real rights, or rights to forbearances binding
indifferently all the world, and proceed tc obligations, jura in
personam; that is to say, rights to certain acts or forbearances

binding exclusively certain individuale.
