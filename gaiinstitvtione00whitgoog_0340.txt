§ 25. 'Po the divergence oi the civil (agnatio) and natural (cognatio)
familias, to the desire, thetis, to correct the non-natural devolution
ol successione, Sir Henry hlaine attributes the introduction in Roman
jurisprudence ol Testamentary dispositione (Ancient Law, ch. vi).

ξ 32. 'Pha praetor, by virtue of his executive power (imperium):

(1) (lave bonorum possessio to a person who had a legal title to the
inheritsnce‚ that is, he enforced the rights conferred on persons by
the civil law (juris civilis confirmandi causa); s. g. he gave bonorum
possessio secundum tabulas to the heir instituted in a will ralid by

he gave bonorum possessio seeundum tabulas to tha heir under a
will invalid at civil law, from wantos mancipation or nuncupation,
2 § 149, and such will was ineffsetive (sins rs) against an agnete
claiming as heir by intestaoy, until a rescript of the Emperor
Antoninus (probably Marcus Aurelius) made such bonorum possessio
effective (cum re) by giving the grantes a good defense against the
civil heir, 2 ξς 119, 120.

(3) He sometimes, though rarely and by something like a streteh
of his authority, gave possession adverse to rights which tha law
had conferred on other persons, that is, he contradioted er corrected
the law. 'Phe principal cases in which he did this were thoas in
which he protected the intarests of emancipated children. Thus by
