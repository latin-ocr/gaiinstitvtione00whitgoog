they can be brought in the form 01 noxal actions against the pater·
familias or dominus. See (hueber, Lex Aquilia, p. 275. Moreover,
Praetorian penal actions can, generally speaking, only be maintained

Itis to he notioed that in case of the death of the delinquent, the
plaintiff had not always an adequate remedy under the Roman law,
when the inheritanoe was not enriched by the delict, e. g. in the case
of damage to property under the lex Aquilia; and English common
law even went beyond the rule 01 Roman law in this respect, since its
principle was that no action 01 Tort (0 term which does not coincide
with but is wider than that 01 Deliot) would lie against the executor
or administrator of the wrongdoer‚ [The maxim, aetio personalis
moritur cum persona, often used by expositore 01 English law, must
have originated in 0 misprint cf personalis for poenalis] But now,
by 3 and 4 Will. IV, 0. 42, an action 101 injury to property, as

opposedtoactions forslanderand the like (vindictive actions,whieh die ·

with the person), is maintainablc against the executore and adminis-
tratore 01 110 wrongdoer‚ provided the wrong was committed within
six months before his death and the action is brought within ayear
after his death, 11 11 was an injury to real property, or within six
months after hie executorscradministratora have taken on themselves
administrationis it was an injuryto personal property. Thus within
the limite 01 thie statute the English plaintiff has an ampler remedy
than the Roman. See Pullook's Iaw 01 Torta, Oh. ΙΙΙ. 1 2.

11 should he remembered respecting the extinction 01 delictal
actions (1) that by reason 01 death Vindictive suits are incapable of
either active or passive transmission (transmiseion to the heir of the
plaintiff or against the heir of the defendant), other delictal actions
being capable of active but incapable of passive transmission, ξ 111,
comm. ; (2) that by prescriptiom Praetorian Pennl suits are generally
limited to a year, while Oivil actions are ‘perpetuae’ §§ llo-113,
comm.; (3) that in the caseos concurrence, i. e. the mergor, absorp
tion, or alternation 01 several coexisting suits, one penal action may
not consume another on account 01110 same offence. (As to the
interpretation of the statement in the Institutas (4, 9, 1) numquam
actiones praesertim poenales de eadem re concurrentes alia aliam con·
sumit, see Dr. Moyle's note, and 01. Windscheid, Pandekten, 2 ξ 326,
n. 8 dr 9.) The importance 01 110 distinction between reparatory and
purely penal actions has disappeared in modern times in consequence
