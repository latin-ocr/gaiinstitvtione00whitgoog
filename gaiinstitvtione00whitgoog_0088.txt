Eques equo publioo was a youth nominated by the emperor to the
turmae equitum; not, however, intended ior actual servios with the
legions, but merely marked out as an expectant of future employ- ·
ment in higher publio iunctione, military or civil. The title oi ,
Princeps juventutis, often conferred bytho emperors on their suo·
cessors designate, denoted the leader of the Equites equo publioo.
This distinction of olasses among Equites lasted down to tha time
of Hadrian, and perhaps latar. In the time of Augustus, and sub·
sequently, the list of judiees (album judicum) was, aooording to
Mommsen (Staatsr. 3, p. 535), taken simply from the Equites

added a new decuria, the Dueenarii, those whose oensua amounted
to 200,000 sesteroes, who judged minor oases; and subsequently
Caligula added a fifth (of. Greenidge’s Roman Publio Life).

Recuperators are judges not taken from the panel (album judi·
oum); see Greenidge’s Legal Prooedure oi Oioero's Time, p. 266.

mulgated an. 506 by Alario 11, king oi the Visigoths oi Spain and
Gaul, contained, besides extracta from the oodex Theodosianus (pro-
mulgated mn. 438), assleotion from the Santontiae of Paulus and
an epitome oi these Institutes oi Gaius. From this epitome it
appears that in the paragrapho now obliterated Gaius prooeedod to
explain the modes of private manumission by whioh a slave became
