enjoying only a portion ol the private rights oi citizenship, com·
mercium without connubium. Here also, then, we have three
η clames, cives, Latini, peregrini.
l The powers of the head of a family came to be distinguished by
, the terma potestas, manus, mancipium: potestas, however, was
ἵ either potestas dominica, power over his slaves, or potestas petria,
³ power over his children, which, at the period when Roman law is
. known to us, were different in kind3 so that the rights of pater·
t iamiliae wera really fourfold. Manus or marital power placed the
³ wile on the footing of filiafamilias, which was the seme as that of
filiusfamilias. Paterfamilias had a legal power oi selling (mancipare)
, his children into bondage; and mancipium, which is also a word
used to denote a slave, designated the status of a filiusfamilias who
hed been sold by his parent as a bondsman to another paterfamilias.
In respect oi his purchaser, such a bondsman was assimilated to
solave: in respect of the rest of the world, he was free and a
citizen, though probably his political capacities were suspended as
long ae his bondage (mancipii musa) lasted, ξ 116*. As eleves are
, bmted of under the head of libertas, and the status of the wile
¹ (manos) was not legally distinguishable from that oi the son,
we may say, thst in respect of domestic dependence or inde
pendence (familia), as well as in respectos libertas and civitas,
men are divided into three classes-paterfamilias, filiusfamilias,
and Qui in mancipio est; paterfamilias alone being independent (sui
juris), the other two being dependent (alieni juris) in uaequal degreea
'lhese different choses are not examined by Gaius with equal
moenera Under the first head he principelly examines the
libertini: the classes under the second head, cives, Latini, peregrini,
are only noticed indirectly‚ ie. so far as they presente type ior the
deminution of libertini; and the bulk oi the first book oi the
Institutione is devoted to domestic relations.
f In modern jurisprudence, Status having disappeared, the law or
ζ , domestic relations-the relation of husband to wile, parent to child,
’ wardiam to ward-constitutos the whole oi that of which formerly
it was only a part, the law of Persona. It differs from the rest of
the civil code in that, while the relations oi Property and Obligation
are artificial and accidental, the relations governed by the code ol
the Family are natural, and aasential to the ematenoe of the human
rece: so much so that the principa] relations ot the family extend
tothe raet ol the animal world, and the portion of the code relating
tothem is called by Ulpian preeminently jus Naturale, Dig. l, l, 3,
lust l, 2 pr. Secondly, whereas every feature oi Property and
obligatos is the creation oi politioal law, Domestio life is only
mxliv governed by politieal law, which leaves the greater portion
