198 SVCCESSIO PER VNIVERSITATEM [11. §b 123-137.
'Phe siterborn stranger, though incapable at civil law 01 being

appointed heir (1242), was relieved by the praetor who gave him
the juxta-tabular possession. J ustinian gave him a civil title, Inst.

1 132. 'I'o the necessity 01 leaving 001110 legacy to the disinherited
aitsrborn sua heres (and 1101, as Blackstone suggests, to the querela
inofficiosi) we may perhaps attribute the vulgar error in England
011110 necessity 01 leaving the heir one shilling in order to cut him
011 effectually. The querela inofficiosi testamenti was aprocess by
which a 11111101111011)1 valid could be either totally or partly upset
at the instance 01 certain near relations on the ground that the
claime of natural affection had been disregarded hythe testator.
The querela inofficiosi was not barred by any legaoy, however slight,
being 1011 10 such relation, but only by giving him one fourth 01 his
intestata portion (§ 152, oomm.; Sohm, § 113. For the changes
which Justinian made in the law 011 this subject see Inst. 2, 18, 1, 2 ;
Novella, 18, 1, and 115). Thus even 0 legacy 1011 10 an afterborn
sua heres would be unavailing 10 0010 the will 110111 being inoffi·
ciosum, unless 11 amounted 10 one fourth 01 her share by descent
Ii no legacy at all were left her, the will would be 111101111οῙ and
absolutely void as against her, unless she was disinherited; 11 less
than a fourth 01 her share were 1011, the will would not be abso·
lutely void but voidable‚ ie. liable 10 be altogether or in part over·
thrown ifshe chose to impeach it as inofficiosum.

§ 135. The Praeteritio 01 a descendant who is suus heres to
the testator or, but 101 emancipation, would be suus heres, entitles
the descendant to bonorum possessio. Ii the praeteritus is filius
011110110ιο0, the will is absolutely void and contra-tabular posses
sionis an 1111001010 succession: hut if the praeteritus is emanci-
patus, the effect of contratabular possession is 10 divide the
inheritance between the praeteritus and other descendants who were
instituted heire, excluding both instituted strangers and disinherited
sui heredes.

Contra-tabular possession might be claimed either by the pras·
teritus himself, 01 by any 01 the instituted sui heredes. For 11 an
instituted heir took less by his institution than he would by this
pertial intestacy, it would be his interest to claim eontra-tabular
possession, commisso per alium edicto, ‘the edict having been
brought into operation by another,' viz. by another descendant, who
had been pretermitted.

The portione 01 the will that remained in force were:

inherited continued, as was mentioned, excluded 110111 the 11111011-
