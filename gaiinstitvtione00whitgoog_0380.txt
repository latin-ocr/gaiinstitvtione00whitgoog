Mandatum). Formal contracta derivo their validity from the
observanoe of a form prescribed by positive law, and calculated to
inspiro by its solemnity serious reflection in the negotiatore, and
to distinguish definitive resolution from preparatory negotiation and
debate. In Real contraot tho earneetnese and definitivenesa of the
resolution is proved by one contractor parting with ownership,
as in mutuum or with physioal control of the thing, as in commo
datum, depositum, pignus. The obligatior, too, contracted by the
other party is perfectly plain, being in most cases simply restitution.
In Exohange (permutatio), an Innominate contraot, the duty of the
promisor is not quite so simple; it ie not restitution, but the
transfer oi an equivalent; and, accordingly, the validity of the con·
traot oi Exohange was not established till a comparatively late
period oi Roman jurisprudence. 'Phe daily and hourly employment
of the Oonsensual contracte oi Purohaae and Hiring, while it would
make the requirement oi any formality intolerably inconvenient,

the world, eo that the mere mention oi their names awalrens as
vivid a picture of their consequences aa could the observante of the
most ceremonious form. ln the remaining Consemual contracte,
Agenoy and Partnership, the position of the Agant or Partner who
is called to account for property that has passed into his hands or
that has boen lost by his negligenoe is ao similar to that of a party
to a Real contraot that there could be no hesitation in extending to
these contracte the protection of the publio tribunale

An agreement that was neither valid by its Form, as was the
the stipulation, nor was one oi the four eonsensual contracte with
their familiar names, nor was a Real or innominata contraot, that
ie, an agreement where on one side the consideration (causa praeter
conventionem, Dig. 2, 14, 7, 4) was executed, nor, though outside
tho olassification of contraot, was made valid by the edict or soma
special statute, was not direotly enioroeable at law, and was called
a Nudum pactum. A Nudo pact, though ineffectual to produce
civilis obligatio, may produce naturalia obligatio. Igitur nuda pactio
obligationem non parit, sed parit exceptionem, Dig. 2, 14, 7, 4.
‘A nude pact creatas no (civil) obligation, but oreates a defenoe.’
Interest on a loan could only be eecured bytho Formal contraot oi
Stipulatio: but a nude pact to pay interest could bc secured by
pignus, Dig. 13, 7, 11, 3, and could be pleaded in bar to a suit for
recovering back the interest when actually paid (condictio indebiti
solatii: and we have seen that exceptio, pignus, solutum non repeti,
are some oi the criteria which indicate the existence of naturalis
obligatio, Dig. 46, 3, 5, 2.
