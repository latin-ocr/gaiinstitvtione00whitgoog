Supposing the statue of a parent changes during the period of
gestation (if, for instance, the mother is a slave at the time ol'
conception and free at the time osbirin), what effect has this ou
the status of the issue? The following rule was adopted: in cases
where the child follows the status of the father, that is, when it is
begotten in civil marriage, the status of the father at the time of
conception determines the status of the ohild; where the child
follows the status of the mother, thetis, when it is begotten in
gentile marriage or in promiscuous intercourse, the status of the
child is determined by the status of the mother at the moment of
birth. Ulpian, 5, 10. ‘Children born in civil wedloclr have their
status lixed at the time of conception ; children born out of civil
wedlock have their status fixed at the time ol delivery.' That is to
say, the legal position ol the musis made to follow the analogy oi its
physicel condition. The physical influence of the father terminatas
with conception: his subsequent health, life, or death, does not
affert the physical state of the ohild; but the child is affected by
every change in the physical condition ol the mother, her health‚
life, or death, up to the moment of birth. In imitation of this
analogy, the status of the child, when it depended on the status of
the father, was not affected by any change in that status subsequent
to the period of conception3 but when it depended on the status of
the mother it varied with every change in that status up to the
moment of birth. By the time of Gaius, though the change is not
mentioned in the text, this rule was modified in favour of liberty,
and it was established that if the mother was free either at
the date of conception or at the date ol birth or at any interme-
diate period, the meus was born free. Si libera conceperit et ancilla
lacta peperit, liberum parit, id enim lavor libertatis exposcit Si
aneilla conceperit et medio tempore manumissa sit, rursus tacta ancilla
peperit, liberum parit, media enim tempora libertati prodesse, non

§tiu Aquae et ignis interdictio was originally a permission to avoid
punishment under the penal code by voluntary exile. Subsequently
it was employed as a punishment, and under the emperors assumed
the form of deportatio in insulam. It was attended with confiscation

ἰ olgoods, and involved loss of civitas but not of libertas, ἕξ 128, 161.
