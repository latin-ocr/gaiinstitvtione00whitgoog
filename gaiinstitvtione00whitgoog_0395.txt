? due deliberation 00 1110 part 01 the contractors, are valid in favour 01
the promisee apart 11001 their object See Appendix 10 this Book.

Although, however, a mere abstract promise in a stipulation spart
from its object was binding, as e. g. do you promise 10 pay 10 aurei?
1 do promise—yet in course 01 time, 0 defendant who had been
induced 10 enter into a stipulation by fraud, or who had 001
received the consideration, on account 01 which his promise was
made, was allowed 10 plead the exceptio doli or ples 01 fraud, an
equitable 1010000, probably introduced by Aquilius Gallus (01. Moyle’s
Inst App. 8, Bk. 3). By this means the circumstances which gave
rise 10 the promise would be brought into consideration in the s
action. The practice 01 glring a written acknowledgment or cautio
101 loans 01 money grew common, and, as has been mentioned, great ὃ
evidentiary importance came 10 be attached 10 such written docu-
ments, especially in the eastern part 01 the empirs.

11, instead 01 generally alleging fraud (siin ea re nihil dolo malo
Auli Agerii iactum est neque fit), the ples 01 the defendant who was
sued on such an acknowledgment alleged the particular 1001 01 his
never having received the alleged loan (exceptio in factum composita), it
was called, in later imperial times, exceptio non numeratae pecuniae.
(led. 4, 30, 1, 3. Compare 4 § 116 si stipulatus sim a 10 pecuniam,
tanquam credendi causa numeratus, nec numeraverim .. . placet per
exceptionem doli mali 10 defendi jubere with Inst. 4, 13, 2 si quis,
quasi credendi causa, pecuniam stipulatus fuerit, neque numeraverit

...placet per exceptionem pecuniae 000 numeratae 10 defendi
jubere.

An important peculiarity 01 the exceptio 000 numeratae pecuniae
was that the bur-den 01 proof was not, as in other exceptione, 00 1110
defendant bnt 00 the plaintiff, who would have to prove in the first
place the payment 01 the money 10 the defendant for which he was
suing. This plea might therefore have the practical effect 01
transfor-ming a loan 01 money due on aformal 00011001 into a real
contract, but this was confined to contracta contemplating a loan 01
money. But by a constitution 011110 Emperor Diocletian (Her-
mogen (lod. l; (lod. Theod. 2, 27, 1; Ood. Just. 4, 30), ii 0 written
aclmowledgment 01 0 debt was thus sued 00, the exceptio non
numeratae pecuniae could only be pleaded within five years irem
the date 01 the contract, which delay was reduced to two years by
Justinian, after which interval the cautio was accepted, ifwe are 10
follow the statement 01 the law made in the Institutas, as incontro·
vertible, and not merely presumptive, preof that the money had been
advanced. After this interval, accordingly, Justinian regards the
written document as 0 formal contract and not simply as evidentiary.
