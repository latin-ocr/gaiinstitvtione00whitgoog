fessing that he oeases to hold in his former character and proceeds
to hold as possessor 115 herede 51 115 possessore. ,
Possessio pro herede was perhaps the germ 51 the 1111551515 suc·
cession of next 51 kin or cognati, a succession, 55 we shall see, not
originally recognized in Roman law3 51 least, the family or next 51
kin 51 511 1111551515 would generally have the best chance of seizing
any movables or immovables that he left; and perhaps it was this
equitable result, 115 less than 1115 object mentioned by Gaius, § 55,
that, 111 the absence 51 5 regular succession 51 cognati, led the public to
look on possessio pro possessore 55 a rational and salutary institution.
The senatusconsultum mentioned in the text, § 57, 15 supposed by
some commentatore 15 be thesemo as one mentioned in the Digest
(5, 3, t), 55 having been passed at the instance 51 the Emperor
Hadrian, when Q. Julius Balbus and P. J uventius Celsus were
consuls, Δ. 11. 129-1151155 called Sc. J uventianum. ’1115 institution
51 usucapio pro herede and pro possessore, cr rather the senatus·
consultum by which it was defeated, has left its traces in the formula,
still to be found in the Digest, 51 the interdict Quorum bonorum,
5 remedy whereby a person who claimed either 55 civil heir (heres),
or as praetorian heir (bonorum possessor), established his claim to
succeed and recovered possession 51 the things belonging to 1115
inheritance. See 4 1 144. To leave these traces in the wording
511115 interdict was according 15 Vangerow no oversight on the

i 1511 51 Justinian, as although in hie legislation the last remnants

51 the institution 51 usucapio pro possessore, that ieby a 111515 fide

¹ possemor, had been definitely abolished ; yet usucapio pro herede, that
, 15, by a bona fide possessor, or one who sincerely though mistakenly
held himself 15 be heir, was still recognized by jurisprudence‚ 1 320.

161. ’1115 circumstances contemplated seem to be as follows:
Α 1151115151 15 debtor to the Roman people or state, and his lands
515 mortgaged 55 55551111 151 the debt. On default of payment‚ the
state exerciaee the power of sale: if the debtoris not turned out of
1555555155 by the purchaser (praedictor) in two 15515 he recovers his
proprietorship by usureception. It seems that the sale by the people

1 was merely the transfer of the mortgage; so that, if the debtor

afterwards satisfied the purchaser, he recovered his land. Kuntze,
