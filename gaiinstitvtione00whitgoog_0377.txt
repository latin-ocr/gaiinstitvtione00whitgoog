owner of a corporea] thing or of giving him a right of servitude, but
its object is to compel him to convey the ownership of something, or
to obligo him to render some service, or make some other restitution.
Dare denotas the transfer of ownership in a certain thing or sum of
money: Facere, the render oi any service other than the transfer of
ownership in a certain thing: and Praestare may possibly signify the
discharge of any obligaticn engendered by maleficium.

However diversified may be the Object of an obligaticn, it is
always transformabis, in the eye of the law, into the payment of a
certain sum ol money. lla enim in obligatione consistere quae
pecunia lui praestarique possunt, Dig. 40, 7, 9, 2. ‘Obligation can
only have for its Object something redeemable and replaoeable by
money.’ Hence if it is desired to bind to the performance of some
act not in its nature susceptible of pecuniary appreciation, it is
necessary to make the direct Object of stipulation the payment of
a certain penal sum, stipulatio poenae nomine, and the non-perform·
anca of the act desired the title or condition whereupon the penal
sum shall be forfeited, as by a bond in English law; for then the
obligaticn, having a pecuniary valae, is a civil obligation enforceable
by the tribunale. The performance of the act desired is thus prae-
tieally enforced‚ although nominally it is removed from the position
of Object of the stipulation to that of Condition.

In speaking of the right ol Dominium or Ovvnership, wo have
already noticed (2 ξ 1, comm.) that besides the primary oarncr of the
right (abstention from molestation), there is always a secondary
object, land, house, slave, or the like, to which such molestation
relatas. So, in view of this transformability of all Objects of obliga·
tion into money payments, we may say that the ultimate oarnor of
every obligaticn isan Alienation, or transfer of property; and ia
always a certain amount of Pecuniary value.

The primary and most comprehensive division of Obligatio is one
that has already been noticed, 1 ξ l, into(A)01v1n1s obligatio, and
(B) namma obligatio.

(Α) Orvnns obligatio is obligaticn enforceable by action, whether
it derives its origin from Jus civile, as tho obligaticn engendered
by formal contracte or the obligaticn enforceable by penalty in a
delictal action, or from that portion of Roman law which belonged
to Jus gentium such as the obligaticn engendered by Formless
contracta, and obligaticn to indemnify engendered by delict.

(B) Obligatio varamus is obligaticn not immediately anforas·
able by action, or obligaticn imposed by that portion of J us gentium
which is only imperfeotly recognized by law; obligaticn, however,
which ie recognized by positive law in various operatione e. g. as
founding a defence called Exceptio, ie. a eontention that the right
