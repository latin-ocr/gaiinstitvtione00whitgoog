xlvi HISTORIOAL INTRODUGTION

Senate of thie period, like that of the Republic, were merely giving
couneel to a magistrate. Gaius attributes tc these decrees ‘the
binding force of law’3 and it does not esem that the early doubts
ae to whether the Senate could paes ordinancee immediately binding
on the community¹ survived the beginning of the Principate.

The Praetors edict still continued to be ieeued; nor are we told
that the edicta] power was in any way infringed during the early
Principate. But there are two consideratione which would lead ue
to conclude that it was seriously weakened. The first ie bseed on
the fact that edictel power in the highest degree was conferred by
law on the Princeps himself ’; and the existence of two interpretcrs
of the civil law poeeeesing equal authority is almost inconcsivable.
The second consideration rests on the probability that the Praetor’s
rulings in detail were subject to the veto of the Princeps. A new
ruling was often the basis for a new formula and a new edict, and
if the first of these was inhibited, its successive developments could
not be realized. Progressive legislation was affected elsewhere, in
decreee of the Senate and in the imperial constitutions3 and the
finci sign that the creative work of the Praetore was a thing of the
past was given when, in the reign of Hadrian (117-138 nn), and
therefore probably in the lifetime of Gaius, the work which Ofilius
had hegun⁸ was perfected by the jurist Salvius Julianus He
reduced the edict to a fixed and definite eystem⁴ ; and from this
time onward the Edictum Perpetuum was, in its essential features,
unalterable. Absolute velidity was given to the new redaction
by e Senatusconsultum introduced by a speech from the Emperor
Hadrian, who declared thet any new point, not contemplated in
the edict, should be decided by analogy with it ⁵. It is probable
that euch new points were still mentioned in successive edicts; for
it is certain that the edict still continued to be iseued annually.
The work of Julian could, therefore, never have been meant to be
unalterable in a literal sense. Such invariability would indeed have
been impossible ; for, though changes in law were now beginning to
be made chiefly by ordinancee of the emperor, yet these very changes
would necessitate corresponding changes in the details of the edict.
