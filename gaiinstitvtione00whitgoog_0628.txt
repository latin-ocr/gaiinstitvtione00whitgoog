Let us consider what is the effect when a disposition originally
vah'd is subsequently followed not by a contrary disposition but by
some other circumstance of an adverse or inconsistent character.
Some jurists laid down a rulo that any circumstances which would
have prevented such a disposition having a validity, 11 they had
been present when the disposition was made, invalidate it if they
occur subsequently. Etiam ea quae recte constiterunt, resolvi Ι
putant, aum in eum casum reciderunt, a quo non potuissent con· '
sistere, Dig. 45, 1, 98, pr. Ε. g. a marriage was dissolved when one
of the parties subsequently lost civitas or libertas. But the rule η
cannot be stated in this broad way: Non est novum, atquae semel
utiliter constituta sunt, durent, licet ille casus exstiterit, a quo
initium capere non potuerunt, Dig. 50, 17, 85, 1. Etsi placeat ex·
tingui obligationem, ai in eum casum inciderit, a quo incipere non
potest, non tamen hoc in omnibus verum cst, Dig. 45, 1, 40, 2.
E. g. acontract isnot dissolved hythe lunacy ol one ol the parties.
similarly a Roman testament lasea its validity when a testator loscs
civitas or libertas, but not when he becomes a lunatio. It seems
theu that no general rule can be applied

A change in tha opposite directim, i. e. from circumstances in-
consistent, to circumstances consistent, with a disposition, will not,
aa a general rule, validate the disposition, or produce what is called
convalescencer Quod initio vitiosum ast, non potest tractu tem·
poris convalescere, Dig. 50, 17, 29. Omnia, quae ex testamenta
proficiscuntur, ita statum eventus capiunt, si initium quoque sine
vitio ceperint, Dig. 50, 17, 201. Catoniana Regula sic definit, quod,
si testamenti lacti tempore decessisset testator, inutile foret, id
legatum, quandocumque decesserit, non valere, Dig. 34, 7, 1, pr.
(cf. 2 ᾗ 244). But though this generally applied to unconditional
legacies, it was not true of institutione of an heir (hereditas), Dig.
1. c. 3, nor of all other dispositione. (Itis to be noticed that ir a
disposition was originally invalid on account of want of capacity of
a party to it the defeat is not cured by the party subsequently
becoming capable,a principle equally applicablc in tha osse ol the
heir as in that of a legatae, 11. 2 ξ 123, Inst. 2, 13, pr.) E. g. when
anon-proprietor alienes and subsequently becomes proprietor, the
alienation, originally invalid, convalesces, and the purchaser becomes
proprietor without a new tradition, Dig. 41, 3, 42, Windsclreid,
1 t 83.

The removal of an exception, e. g. the voluntary ratification 11
1 contract that was originally vitiated by force or fraud, has prac-
ticslly the same effecta 11 convalescence; but cannot properly be
called convalescence, because here the disposition, which ia supple·
mented by a subsequent agreement between the parties, is not
