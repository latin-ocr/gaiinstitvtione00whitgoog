'l'he dates of the three epocha which we have touched on can only
be vaguely indicated. We have no knowledge of the year, or even
of the century, when the smeller politica] unite, out of which Rome
was formed, became so thoroughly marshalled under the rule of a
commen government that the customs of the Olane were made to
conform tc the principles laid down and enforced by a single superior
authority. For the second epoch-the period, that is, at which an
attempt was mede to secure a uniform system oi law which would
be binding equally on Patricians and Plebeians—tradition dces
supply a date, one, however, that has more than once been doubted
by modern writers on Roman History and Law¹. This traditional
date is comprised in the years 451-448 a.c.‚ years which the Romans
believed to mark the creation of the Decemviral Commission and the
publication of the Law el the Twelve Tables The third tendency-
that ottho unification of Reme with Italy-although it had begun to
be felt in isolated cases from a very early period of Reman History,
may be said to have received its final impulse at the close of the great
war sor Italian ireedom, generally known ss the Social war, in 89
s. c. 'Phe last epoch—thet of imperial unification-may be said to
have been ushered in by the accession of Caesar to supreme power in
49 a. c It had not been closed even by the time of Gaius, about the
middle oi the second century s. n.; for, even at that late period
the Esstern part of the Empire still abode by Eastem forms oi law ².
It may even be questioned whether the Ediet of Caracalla, which
is believed to have extended Roman citizenship to all the free
inhabitants of that portion of the world that was ruled by Rome,

¹ Pers, in his Stortc cz· Βοπια, has stated the view that the Decemviral legisla-
tion has been medetei by about a century and a half. He brings it down to
the close of the foumh century nc. He believes that Appius Claudius, the
Demi-ir, is a duplicate of Appius Claudius, the censor oi 812 ac, and thet
the story of a publication by the Decemvirs is a duplicate ot the story ol the
revelation of the forms of Law by Gn. Flavius in 804 ac. Lambert has gone
still further in a view expreseed in three werke (la witon de l'cuttent'ciit dea
ΙΙΙ Tables et lea Annuus Martmt,· Le smerden clu droit cira cempcre',· L‘bs'atotrc
odiumne dea ΧΠ Tables). lle thinks that the Twelve Tables, aa a code,
originated with Sextus Aelius Paetus, consul in 198 a.c.‚ whom tradition
regards as their earliest commentator. although he admits that there may have
men successive partiat compilatione before this date.
