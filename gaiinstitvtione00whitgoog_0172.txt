Aa women were capable oi administration, the tinctione of the
guardian, which in the case of infanta were either administrativa
or sanctionative, in the case of women were confined to sanctioning.
Pupillorum pupillarumque tutores et negotia gerunt et auctoritatem
interponunt: mulierum autem tutores auctoritatem dumtaxat inter·
ponunt, Ulp. ll, 25. Itis transparent that the wardship of women
after full age was not designed to protect their own interests, but
those oi their heirs apparent, their agneten Originally the autho·
rizntion of the guardian was not sufficient to validate the will of an
independent woman: it was necessary that she should first break
the ties of agnation, and separate from her family by means of a
coemption (with her guardian's sanction) and subsequent reman-
cipation and manumission. She then, with the sanction of the
manumissor, in his character oi fiduciary guardian, could make
a valid will. In the time ol Gaius, Hadrian having abolished
the necessity of coemption, to make a valid will an independent
woman only required the sanction of her guardian, 2 ξ 112, and
Claudius, as we have seen, had put an end to agnatio guardianship‚
5 171.

When a woman was liberated from the administrativa control of
her guardian, and the guardian had no longer any interest in the
succession to her property, the simplest· course would have been to
declara her dispositione valid without his sanction-to declara her
no longer a ward. But with characteristic conservatism oi forms,
Roman law, to avoid the open change, declarsd the auctoritas still
necessary, but made it compulsory instead ol voluntary-gave the
ward a power of extorting it from the guardian, 2 ἕξ 80-85. So
the act whereby a testamentary heir accepts an inheritance was
originally absolutely voluntary: but when truste (fidei commissa)
were introduced, and the heir as trustes or fiduciarius by ground·
lessly refusing to make the necessary aditio, which in thia case was
the marest iorni, could produce intestacy‚ and thus deprivs tha
beneficiam fidecommissarius, or cestui qua trust oi the provision
destined for him by the bounty of the testatore instead oi declaring
the aditio ol the heres unneoessary to the acquisition of the fortune
by fideicommissariam or that in such a cass the beneficiary should
be deemed to be a direct substitutus oi the heres; or that the
vexatious refusal of the heres should be deemed to be an aditio and
