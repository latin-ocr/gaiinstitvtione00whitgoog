As the usufructuary has no possession, it follows a fortiori that
the usuary has no possession. [Although the jus in 10 called usus
must be distinguished 11011 possession, the words usucapio, usurpatio

servitudes, though not the subject 01 possession, yet 00 100
incorporales, were the subject 01 quasi-possession, § 139, 0. g. Qui
