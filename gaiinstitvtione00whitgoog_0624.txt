An explanation of the nature of Exceptions requires to be basod
on a revicw of the general incidente of litigation. ⁸

In every action there is some contention, allegation, or averment
of a plaintiff which is met or encountered by some contention
allegation, or averment of a defendant.

'I'he contention of the plaintiff contained in the intentio is the
assertion of some right of the plaintiff : e. g. in evindicatio cr real
action, the assertion of dominion or jus in re (si paret illam rem Auli
Agerii esse): in apersonal action, the assertion ol an obligation or
jus in personam (si paret Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio illam
rem dare oportere). In an aetion with a formula in factum concepta
there is an implicit or indirect assertion of a right although explicitly
aud directly the intentio only asserts the fact which forms the title
on which such right is founded. In the wording cf the formula the
right of the plaintiff appears as an hypothesis ; because the formula or
instruction to the judex is a hypothetical commend, expressed ina
sentence of which the intentio forms the antecedent or protasis, and

· the condemnatio the consequent or apodosis.

The contentiori of the defendant is either

(A) a radmor of the alleged right of the plaintiff‚ or

(Β) an affirmation ofa oosnmrus, countervailing right of the
defendant whereby the alleged right of the plaintiff is counterpoised
and counteracted.

The denial of the plaintiffs right again admits of division:

1. It is either a simple and absolute negation of the plaintifi’s
right: an assertion of its ueneristence even in the past: au affirma· ’
tion of its original nullity ; or

2. A qualified or relative negation. Admitting or assuming that
it once existed, it isa negation of its present existence: an affirmation
of its subsequent destruction, nullification, or avoidance.

Accordingly a defendant had three lines of defence:

Ι. The assertion of the original uuunrrv cf the plaintifl's right.

This might be either a denial (traversa) of the fact, whether a
disposition or a trespass, on which the plaintiff’s right was alleged tc
be founded (general issue of English law).

Orthe denial of the law by which aucha right was said to be
annexed to such a fact (demurrer of English lawt The question
whether in the formulary system a pure issue of law was decidsd
by the praetor in jure (denegatio actionis, when the demurrer was
sustained; datio actionis, when it was overruled) without reference
to a judex, is immaterial to our present purpose, which is merely
an exhaustive view of the various modes of defence open to a
defendant.

Or it might be an admission of the fact alleged, with an allegation
