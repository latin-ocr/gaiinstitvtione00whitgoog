massae into which legislation naturally breaks itself—what are the
joints and articulations which separate the whole code into various
subordinate codes, like the different limbs and members oi an
organis whole-what is the import of the Gaian division, adopted
perhaps from previous writers, into jus personarum, jus nerum, jus
actionum, or rather, to adhere to the classical phrases, jus ad per·
sonas pertinens, jus ad res pertinens, jus ad actiones pertinens?

By jus ad actiones pertinens, to begin with the easier part of the
problem, there is no doubt that the inventor of the division intended
to designate the law oi PROOEDURE as opposed to the law of
rights; the adjective code, to nse Bentham's phraseology, ss opposed
to tha substantive code. There is as little doubt that in the Institu-
tione of Gaius this design is not executed with precision, and that,
instead of the law of procedure, the last portion of his treatiee
contains also to some extent the law of mactioning rights, as opposed
to the law of primary rights (For the meaning of this distinction
see Austin’s Jurisprudence, blr. Ι.) Or perhaps we should say that
the legislative provisions respecting Procedure have a double aspect:
a purely formal aspect, so far as they give regularity and method
to the enforcement of sanctioning rights; anda material aspect,
eo far as certain stages of procedure (e. g. litis contestatio and res
judicata) operate like Dispositions or any other Tities to modify
the substantive rights of the contending parties. Procedure, then,
is treated of in these Institutione partly indeed in its formal
character, but still more in ite material character, ie. so far as its
incidente can be regarded as belonging to the substantive code.

It is more difficolt to determine the principle oi the other division,
the relation of the law of Persona to the lawof Things. They both
deal with the rights and dutiae of persons in the ordinary modern
acceptation of the word; why then, we may inquire, are certain
rights and duties of persons separated from the rest and dealt with
under the distinguishing category of jura personarum? It is not
enough to say with Austin that the law of Things ie the universal
or general portion of the law, the law of Persons, a particular and
exceptional branch; that it is treated separately on account of no
essentiol or characteristic difference‚ but merely because it is com·
modicus to treat separately what is special and exceptional from
what is general and universal. This answer furnishes no positive
character of the law ot Persona, but only the negative character
of anomaly, i. e. of unlikeness to the larger portion of the law3
but it would be difficult to show that the law of Persona ie more
exceptional, anomalous, eccentric, than the Civil dispositione as
opposed to the Natural dispositione of the law of 'Phingsi

We must look to the details of the law of Persona, and observo
