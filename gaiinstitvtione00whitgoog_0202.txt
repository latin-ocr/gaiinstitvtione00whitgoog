whieh contained the dues from the Publio Provinees (V ita Marci, 22,
Dio Cassius, lxxi. 33).

During the Republio the taxes peid by provinciale had been
ealled stipendium-a word whioh points to the view originally taken
that these ravenues were meant to meet military expenses; for
stipendium means pay for the army. During the Principale the
word tributum eame also to be used for imperial taxes ; but this
passage of Gaius shows that stipendium was still employed for the

dues paid by the Publio Provinees. 'Phe distinction between stipen-
diary and tributary provinces is perhaps based on a differenoe in
the mode of oolleeting, not oi levying, the taxes. It seems that in
the Publio Provinees the taxes were still oolleeted by the loeal
governments themselves and peid to the Quaestors, whereas in
Gaesar’s Provinoes the Procuratores eame into diruet oontaet with the
tax-payer. The mode of oolleetion was in the seeond ease disset,
in the first indireet. It is also possible that the ownerehip ofthe soil
in Gaesar’s Provinoes was regarded as vested in the Prinoeps, that
of the soil in the Publio Provinoee as vested in tha Roman state (see
Mommsen, Staatsreeht, ii. p. 1088), and this distinction may be im·
plied in the two olesses oi provinoialia praedia mentioned by Gaius.

The mode ol taxation was uniform for the whole Empire, and the
aesessments were made at intervals by the Emperor's effieials. 'l'he
taxes were either imports on the land (tributum solilor on the person
(tributum eapitis). The land-tax was in most provinees paid either
in money or grain, more usually in the former, although in eertain
minor districts it was delivered in the form of other produoe. ‘rho
personel tax might ba one on professione, ineome, or movable
, property. Oeeasionally it was a simple poll-tax, this latter burden
being probably impossd on those provinoiale whose property fell
below a eertain rating.

originally on jurisdiction to preside over legis aetio, but this was
afterwards eonferred upon them, Tae. Ann. 12, 60.
