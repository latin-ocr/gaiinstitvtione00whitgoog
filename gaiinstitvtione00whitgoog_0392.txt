§ 92. Before vve proceed to examine Fermal, that is to say,
Verbal and Iiiteral contracta, it is desirable to explain the differente
between aformal and informal contract.

A Formal Disposition is one for which, under pain of nullification,
the necessary or exclusively valid form of expression or mani·
festation of intention is prescribed by the law. A Formleas Dis·
position isone where the individual ia free to chooae the form of
expressing, or mode of manifesting‚ hia intention.

These accessory formalities and solemnities are ancillary to the

essential purpose of the transaction, being destined partly to prevent ⁴

rash and inconsiderate engagements, partly to furnish evidence and
proof of the agreement or principel part of the transaction.
