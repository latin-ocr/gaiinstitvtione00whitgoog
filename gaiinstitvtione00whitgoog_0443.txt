111. §emb-162] DE MANDATO 383

pater, and if D were an independent person, creditor of Cicero pater,
the debt of Cicero pater to D.

Mandata might be employed to operate a kind ol transfer of
obligation, or rather perhaps the right of action arising from obliga·
tion, without, like Delegation or Novation, requiring the concurrence
of the debtor, by Mandatum Agendi—the mandate by the creditor of
his rights of action to a third party (mandare, cedere, praestare
actiones). The creditor made the third party by mandate his
processuel representative (cognitor, procurator, cf. 4 ξς 83, 84), the
understanding being that though the mandatary must carry on the
action in the name of the mandator (cf. 4 ξ 86), he was in fact to
recover for himself. Hence such an assignee in the form oia
processual agent is called cognitor or procurator in rem suam, the
benefit of the obligation, as distinct from the obligation itself, being
transferred to him.

It was not without difficulty that this mode of assignment was
rendered suitable forits purpose, the revocable nature of the contract
oi mandatum and the fact that it was put an end to by the death ol
either party being obstacles to its becoming so. But while a cognitor
or procurator, after the stage oi litis contestatio in an action had been
reached, when the formula was issued, had control of the proceedings,
and so could not after this be removed, it cameto be established that
notice to the debtor of the assignment cf the debt should have the
same effect in the way of preventing revocation as litis contestatio,
so that from the date of notice the debtor was bound to pay the debt
to the assignee3 cf. Sohm, ξ 87. Moreover, in the event of the mandate
being dissolved by death, the praetor allowed the representative of
the assignee to recover by actio utilis.

In later Roman law subsequently, it appears, to the time of Gaius,
actio utilis was given in all cases where an intention to assign was
shown, although amandatum agendi had not been given. By this
praetorian action—which is supposed by some writers to have been
based on the fiction that the assignes had been made procurator,
hut is more probably actio in factum-the assignee sued in his own
name and not in that of his creditor. cod. 4, 15, 5, Diocletian
and Maximian, nn. 294. In solutum nomine dato non aliter nisi
mandatis actionibus ex persona sui debitoris adversus ejus debitores
creditor experiri potest. Suo autem nomine utili actione recte utitur.
Here we may seem to have the principle cf the transferability of
obligations recognized in Roman law.

But the cessicn cr assignment was never completely detached from
the person and liabilities ol the assigning creditor. The cessionary
or assignee was open to all the exceptions, except those of a purely
personal nature, that might heve been opposed to the original
