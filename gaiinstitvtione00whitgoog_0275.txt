Suus heres is a lineal descendant as opposed to the legitimus heres
or nearest agnato, who is a collateral relation, on whom the inheritance
devolvas by the lex duodecim Tabularum in case there are no sui:

; and he is an immediate heir as opposed tc an eventual heir. For

instance, a grandson by an uuemancipated son is in the grandfather’s
power, and may eventually be his heir, but is not his suus heres
during ths life oi the son.

55 158-162. After acquiring an inheritanoe the heir became
personally liable tc the testator's creditore for the full amount of the
testator’s debts But to relieve suist necessarii heredes from being

5 thus compulsorily burdened, the beneficium abstinendi was given
5 them, 5 158. The praetor could not, indeed, unmake, any more than
³ he could make, aheres, but by hie control over procedure he could

put a person who had a civil title in the same position as ifhe had

1 none, while, on the other hand, he regarded persons, having no civil

, title to the inheritance, as il they were heredes
³ Adquiritio hereditatis by an externa] or voluntary heres may

³ probably have required at first in all cases a formal act (cretio) ; but

acting the pert of heres (pro herede gerere), however informally, came
1ο he recognized as equivalent in legal effect to a formal declaration,
unless an institution was expressly made ‘cum emtione! 'Phe object
of instituting an heir ‘curn cretione’ was to oblige him to accept or
abendon the inheritanoe within a prescribed term. For otherwise
the law allowed him to postpone his decision indefinitely, § 167.

It wasto get rid of the inconvenience caused by leaving the
inheritanoe open fora long period, that the praetor at the request of
creditore of the estate fixed a period, generallya hundred days

, (tempus deliberandi), aiter which he authorized the sale of the pro·

party, 5 167. When it became customary ior the praetor to proscribe
this time for deliberation, the formularies of cretio had no intelligible
policy and were regarded as irksome. After being dispensed with
in certain cases by other¹ emperors, they wera totally abrogated by
Arcadius and Theodosius, ao. 407. Ood. 6, 30, 17 orationum
scrupulosam sollennitatem hac lege penitus amputari decernimus
‘Solemn declaration with ite embarrassing formalities is hereby
decreed to be absolutely abolished.' (For allusione to cretio by Oioero

' aas Roby, Roman Law, 1, p. 396 and App. Bk.111.) For the

repudiation of an inheritenoe by a voluntary heir ιιο solemn form
was at any time in use, and perhaps such repudiation was not legally
recognired in early lew, though it was possible for the heres to assign
his right by injure cessio. 'I'hus an inheritance could not be lost
any more than it could be acquired by amere expression of intention,
and it has been suggested that the abeyance of inheritanoes on this
account was a cause which gave riae to bonorum possessio. In the
