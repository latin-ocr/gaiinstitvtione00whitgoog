the debts of the deceased, he might by succeeding to cn insolvent

(lessio bonorum was introduced by alex Julia, ξ 78, anacted
either by Julius or Augustus Caesar, and if by the latter, in
imitation of a measure of the former which he himself has recorded.
In the year 48 s. c. when Caesar was consul, credit having collapsed
in consequence of the civil war, debtors being generally insolvent,
and money having disappeared, Caesar allowed them to discharge
their obligations by the transfer of their estates, movable and
immovcble, to their creditore, at the value, appraised by arbitrators,
’ which they would have borne before the commencement of the war,
De Bello civili, 3, 1. Cossio bonorum confer-red three benefite on

not involve infamy!

Proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency, in modern days, may

as assisting the creditore to recover as much as may be of their
rightful claims, or as a mode of liberation, that is, as a relief of an
unfortunate debtor, relcasing him of his debte without paymcnt,
and enabling him to ‘begin the world again’ without the over·

law, with the approval of the Court, a bankrupt may be discharged
of his obligations by payment of a dividend often shillings in the
