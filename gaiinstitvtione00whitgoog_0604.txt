Directly extinctiva (ipso jura) consumption oi a right of action
vanished with the formulary system, and in Justinian’s time the
everment cf Res judicata is only found under the form of Exceptio
cr a Oounteractive pica. Indead, when the judex ci the republican
period ceased to be commisaicued tc hear and determine causes, one
of the conditione cf J udicium legitimum, cf which such consumption
was a consequence (unus judex, t 107), was always of necessity
wanting. ’

But this was not the only change: the consumption of a right cl
action by the operation oi Res in judicium deducta, whether asa
direetlyextinctiye (ipsc juretur a ccunteractire plea (ope exceptionis);
in other words, necessary Novation operated by Litis contestatio,
was also abrogated and is not to be found in the statuteboolr of
Justiniara Even the operation of Res judicata, sofar as it was
governed by the same rulea as Res iu judicium deducte and merely
indicated by its name a later stage of the proceedings (sententia lata),
may also be said to have been abolished. 'Phe rulcs, that is tc say,
which govemed the transformed Exceptio rei judicatae, as it prevaiicd
in the time of Justinian, were much more rational and flexible than
the hard-andiast doctrine of Necessary novati0n‚ whether by litis
contestatio or by Sententia lata, which prerailed in the time of
Statute-prccess, t 108, and apparently survived to the days of Gaius
In determining whether the exceptio rei judicatae should beallowad
to put astop to the maintenance of a new action, the judge in
Justinian’s time would have to consider whether the second action
raised the same question between the same parties as the first action;
in other words, whether the reasons why the plaintiff'a first action
was dismissed were still applicablc in the cass of the second action
It they were, the exceptio would prevail, if not, ife. g. thc plaintiffs
first action had been dismissed in consequence of Plus petitio or soma
dilstory plea or by consumption of process (duratiou cf suit for
eighteeu months, or termination of praetorship), he was no longer
held to have eternally forfeitcd his claim: but suitors were merely
restrained, in accordancc with the real object of the institution,
from harassing their opponente with renewed litigation on the
precise questions that had once been adequately decidcd. The opera·
tion of the plea was not less powersul nor less extensive, but made
more completely conformable to equity. savigny, ξς 280-301.
