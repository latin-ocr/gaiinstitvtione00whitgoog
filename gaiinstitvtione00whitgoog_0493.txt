ABSTRACT CONTRACT 433

tha lateraria os his principat. Herc the italicized words show the
causat factore which the rancus unilateral dispositione require lor
their support: and similarly all other unilateral pects might be
shown to be dependent factore of compound bilateral transactione.

Each correlated unilaterel disposition is both cause and effect
Eaeh is a lever by which the will of one of the contractors is moved.
Each is the efficient or motor cause of the other: and (as wills
are only moved by motivas or ends) each is the final cause of the
other.

Although they are thus reciprocally dependent, yet generally in
practice one habitually precedes, and thus appears to be the causal
factor3 while the onewhich habitually follows appears to be the
sequent or dependent factor. 'Phia is always the case iu Real and
Innominate contracte, where one disposition has always passed
beyond the limits oi mere agreement into an alienation cf property
(mutuum, the innominata contracta do ut des, do ut faciasl: alienation
of possession (pignusle alienation of detention (depositum, commo.
datuml: or performancc of service (the innominata contracte facio ut
des, facio ut facias).

The Form of a disposition is what we have elsewhere called its
Declaration. All dispositione have two elementa or aspecta, one
extemal or corporat. the other 'internal or mental. Intemelly they
are the Intention of a disposer or disposers; externally they are the
expression or manifestetion os this intention. ¹

Fortuna contract separatas the sequent lrom the causal factor
of a bilateral agreement, clothes the intention in a strongly marked,
sometimes strangely charactered, externat expression, manifestation‚
or roan, in exact conformity to the prescription of archaia law or
primevel custom, and thus constitutes a unilateral contract valid
by form. Foannnss contract is bound by no requirement of Form
and has no validity in isolation from its cause. Forsan contracte
from the separation or absuacuon of the sequent from the causal
factor, are appropriately called uernam while for the opposite
reason sommas contracta may be denominated concnam.

Abstract contracta sometimes contained in their formalitiesa
shadowy recognition of their departure from the concrete realities
of life-a confession oi the necessity ol a supporting Oause in
actual commerce; but sometimes contained no such avowal. 'I'hus
Expensilatio contained the phantom of a money loen, the analogon
oi the ‘Value received’ clause in a modern bill of erchange. But
this recognition was not universa13 lor stipulatio, whatever may

suggests prepayment by thepromisee: if connected with Stipes, it

merely significa a binding formula), in the shape with which we are
