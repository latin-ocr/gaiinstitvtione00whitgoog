Among the objecta that could not be secured by stipulation, and
still less by any Formless contract, are Dispositions under the code
of Family law (the lawe governing domestic relations) or tha code
of Succession Eg. no promise of marriage (sponsalia) was legally
binding—a striking contrast to the rulo 01 English law. Nor do
we hear 01 any binding agreement to a future Emancipation, Adop-
tion, 01 Arrogation3 or ior the principal acts relating to the law
of Succession, to the execution 01 a Will 01· to the aditio of an
inheritanoe. In all these solemn Dispositions the Roman legislator
deerned it expedient that the dispossr should have an entire freedom
of choica at tha moment 01 making the Disposition.
