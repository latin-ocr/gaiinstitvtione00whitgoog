(ι) Ρ1000110 rogans (the holder of 0 thing merely by permission of
another) generally had what may be called derivative possession:
commodatarius (1110 10110001) never had more than detention.

(1) The obligatior in Precarium which was not originally regarded
asaoontract, 01801110, p. 354, 0. 5, 10 purely unilateral and on the
side of precario rogans, being simply that 110 should restore the thing
to the person for whom he holds it. Precario dans (the person who
allows another to hold property for him) is under no obligation, 001
0100 the semi-bilateral obligatior 101 impensae dra, which is in·
cumbcnt cu Commodans (the lender).

(3) Precatio rogans is 001, lihe' commodatarius, responsible for
diligentia, Dig. 43, 26, 8, 3. Ρ100011001 000010 at first to have been
applicable only to land but afterwards to have 1000 extended to
movable property.

At a late period of Roman law Precarium was so far regarded as
a contractual obligation that Precario dans could recover by an actio
praescriptis verbis, Dig. 43, 26, 2, 2, and 19, 2. Thus Precario dans had
two remediss, an action te recover possession (interdictum de precario)
and anaction 00 0001111011 commodans had only his action on contract3
interdicte, aswe 111110 stated, not being employed to enforce contracte.

§ 156. Paulus mentioned another kind of interdicta duplicia,
nemely, those for either acquiring or recovering possession. Sunt
interdicta, ut diximus, duplicia tam reciperundae quam apiscendae
possessionis, Dig. 43, l, 2, 3. These are 1110 interdicte, Quem fundum,
Quam hereditatem, Quem usumfructum, which have been already
quoted, 5 89, whereby, if the defendant 10 0 1001 action refused to
give security judicatum solvi, possession was transferred to the
plaintiff, who iu some cases would acquire, in others recover
possession Quem fundum was the interdict employed in Vindicatio:
Quam hereditatem in Hereditatis petitio: Quem usumfructum in the
action, claiming an usufruct. In interdict procedure, instituted for .
the retention of possession, analogous functione were performed by
further interdicte called interdicta Secundaria, § 170.

Pending litigation respecting Urban servitudes the plaintiff was
protected by a peculiar institution, the interdictum Demolitorium
based on Operis 0011 nuntiatio, the nature 01 which demandsa
passing 001100. 11 Α, 11 person entitled 10 00010 real right (mort-
gagee, emphyteuta, superficiarius), was aggrieved by some architec-
tural innovation (aedificatio, demolitio) on the part of B, whereby Ι
00 urban servitude 0101 the tenement 01 A was asserted or some
urban servitude [jus habendi or jus prohibendi] belonging to A,
as owner of 0 dominaut tenement, was violated, A was entitled
10 serve a formal inhibitiou or private injunction on B (prohibitio,

operis novi nuntiatio) summoning him to desist from the innovation.
