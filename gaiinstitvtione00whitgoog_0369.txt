11111101] BONORVM 10001110 000

101100 01 the debtor’e liability in very exceptional cases, e. g. in the
case ofa slave instituted heres necessarius, 2 1 155, 10 order to save
the 01011101 an insolvent testator. After once becoming heir 10
the insolvent inheritance, whether he wished it or 001, such a person
was 001 liable to further molestation. (cf. the restrictiori 01 liability
allowed to an heir by the beneficium inventarii 01 J 00110100.) But
the alter-acquired property 01 other insolvents remained liable to
successive sales until plenary satisfaction 01 their debis had been
made. Accordingly, bankruptcy is 001 00010010101, t 168, as one
01 the modes 01 extinguishing obligatior.

Το encourage the bankrupt, however, to 010110 abonorum cessio,
in order that 00 much as possible might be saved from the wreck
01 his 10110000 101 the benefit 011110 creditore, bonorum cessio not
only discharged him, as we have seen, 11001 personal execution, but
discharged 11010 liability such portion 01 his after-acquired property
ae was necessary 101 his subsistence. Qui benis cesserint nisi
solidum creditor receperit non sunt liberati, (101. 7, 71,1. Ιο qui
bonis cesserit, siquid postea acquisierit, in quantum 100010 potest
convenitur, Dig. 42, 3, 4. See 4 t 43, 000101.

The property 010 debtor who madeavoluntary essignment was sold
by the creditore in the same way 00 when it was taken compulsorily.

Bonorum sectio differed from bonorum venditio in that it vested
quiritary, and not merely bonitary, property iu the purchaser. Some
Ι011011001 condemnatione involved confiscation, 0011110001001 the
01110111010001010 (also 01 booty taken in war) 10 thie way was con-
ducted 001 bya magister but by a quaestor 01 the 111000οῪ, who sold

In the laet period 01 1101000 law, euch as we find in the time 01
J ustinian, venditio bonorum was eupereeded by distractio bonorum,
which involved no 1100010101 the juris universitas. A curator was
appointed by the praetor, 001 instead 01 selling the active and
passive universality 01 the insolvent’s 001010 10 0 purchaser who
became liable to the insolvent's creditore, merely sold the active
