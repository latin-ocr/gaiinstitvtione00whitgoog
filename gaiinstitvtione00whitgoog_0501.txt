'SIMULATIVE DISPOSITION S 441

surrender before the magistrate or fictitious vindication, just as any
inheritancs could be claimed by genuine hereditatis petitio. But we
find that only the intestata succession of a collateral (legitima
hereditas) could be thus conveyed, if, made after aditio, it transferred
only the corporea] property of the inheritanoe, not the inhsritance
itself, 2 ξ 35. of. Sohm, p. 533, n. 3.

In Mancipatio, although the fictitious payment suffieed for the
transfer of dominion, yet actual payrnent or credit was required
for the purpose oi making the alienor subject to auctoritas, that
is, to liability to repay twice the purehase money in the event of
eviction‚ Paulus, 2, 17, 13. cf. Muirhead, Roman Law, ξ 30.

Again, the Census, like a year of jubileo, appears to have
liberated from genuine bondage3 but not to have broken the
fictitious bondage oi a son who was in the course of emancipation,

(loemption, we are told, transferred to the husband the universal
estate of the wife, 2 ξ 98. We may suppose that it had not a similar
effect on the property of a woman who merely made a coemption
for the purpose of changing her guardian or acquiring testamentary
capacity, though it may perhaps have been that the transfer took
place but that the coemptionator was under a fiducia to retransfer it.

The genuine sale of a wife was probably forbidden at an early period
under the severest religione sanctiens: this did not prevent the
simulated sale (remancipatio) of a woman by her coemptionator,
i. e. the simulating disposition when once established was free from
the supervening rules of the simulated disposition.

Α Testament was originallya Mancipation 3 but the familia orjuris
universitas, the object of testament, is not found in the catalogue of
mancipable things (res mancipil: a testament was revocabis a
mancipation irrevocable: the mancipation itself could not have its
operation suspended or made contingent on a condition, though it
could be made subject to nuncupatory and fiduciary claims; a testa·
ment became by means of the nuncupatory part of the mancipation
a disposition defuturo and might be conditional: a mancipation
only conveyed real rights 3 nexum, which imposed obligation, though
cognate, was a distinct institution: testament invested the heir with
the entire property of the deceased, including his obligationes man·
cipation only affected the alienor and alienae ; testament conferred
rights on heirs and legatees, i. e. strangers who had in no way co·
operated in the execution of the testament. The sacrifice of reality
to fiction by the slavish adherence to the rules of domesticum
testimonium makes it the more remarkable that the testament should
have burst asunder so many other restrictione of mancipation.
