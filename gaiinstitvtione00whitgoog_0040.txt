xxxiv HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION

One important point in which the governor of a province differed
from a Praetor at Rome, was that he was an administrative as well
aa a judicial official. Hence the Provincial Edict had to contain
a good many rules of administrativa law which were not to be ⁸
found in its counterpart at Rome. 'Phia portion of the edict spoke

about the finanoial relations of the states of the province to the
Roman government and to ite agents, and stated the mles which
regulated tho relations of the tax-gutherers (Publiceni) to the tax·
payers The rest of the edict which took a definite shape, covered
the procedure which the governor promised to apply for the recovery
of certain rights by individusls—rights such as those entailed in in·
heritanoo or the seiaure of a debtor’s goods These rules were based
on those of Roman law; but they were mene outlines capable oi
adaptation to the local customs of the subject states. But there was,
at least in certain provinces, a portion of ¹the edict, still dealing with
the rights of individuale, which assumed no definite shape. There
were points on which tho governor did not care to frame rulas until
he knew the emergencies which he would have to meet. He was
content (at least Cicero was, when governor of Cilicia) with pro·

mising that, in issuing decrees on such points, he would conform to
the principles of the urban ediots ¹.

If we ask what was the great motivo power which lay behind
this development of law through interpretation by the magistrate,
we shall find it to conciet, partly in contact with foreign peoples;
partly (although probably in a less degree) in the new educational
influences which were moulding the lives oi the Roman nobles
'l'he tendency to experiment and adaptation‚ to a disbelief in any·
thing fixed and rigid, isthoroughly Roman; but external circum· .
stances were very largely responsible for the particular lines on
which this tendency was to move The legal consequence of contact
with foreign racesie summed up in the phrase J us Gentium. The
word ‘Gentes' in this collocation means ‘the world²’; and it is
possible that, when the expression Jus Gentium was first formed,

¹ Cicero thus skctches the contente of the whole edict which he published as
governor of cilicis (ad su vi. 1. 15) :—‘ Unum (genus) est provinciale, in quo est
de rationibus civitatum, ds aere alieno, de usura, de syngraphis; in eodem omnia
de publicanis. Alterum, quod sine edicto satis commode transigi non potest, de
hereditatum possessionibus, de bonis possidendis vendendis, magistris faciendis :
quae cx edicto et postulari et fieri solent. Tertium, de reliquo jure dicundo

ἄγραφον reliqui. Dixi me ds eo genera mss decreta ad edicta urbana
accommodatarum!
