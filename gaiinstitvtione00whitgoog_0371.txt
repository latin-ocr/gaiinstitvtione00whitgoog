tion from the mass of euch things found in the possession of the
insolvent as were not really his property but the property of other
persons called Separatists.

Separatist chimenis are those claimants

(ι) Who can sue for a thing by any form oi Real action, whether
a rei vindicatio, or actio Publiciana (rei vindicatio utilis), or here·
ditatis petitio, or actio confessoris brought to recover some Personal
servitude like ususfructus An actio in rem confessoris to enforce
a Real servitude is obviously notan interest of a nature to give
a right of separation. These who had apignus or hypotheca were
also ranked by the Romane among the Separatiets: in modern law
they take their place among the creditors proper or concurrent, who
have priority.

(2) Or Separatists are claimants who have a Personal action
whereby they can have a claim against the insolvent in respect of
eome specilic thing in his hands; euch as actio commodati, depositi,
locati, mandati, condictio furtiva, interdictum unde vi, actio de
pauperie, or actio quod metus causa.

(B) The final stage is the distribution of the realized proceeds of
the present assets among the concurrent creditore according to their
claesification. The execution does not effect a discharge of the
insolvent, and therefore subsequent assets will be subject to a
subsequent distribution.

In modern Roman law creditore have been sometimes marshallcd
in five classes. (For Roman law itseli on this subject, cf. Roby, 2,
pp. 436, 437.)

1. Creditors with an Absolute privilege, viz. creditors for the funeral
expensesoftheinsolvent. Modern law adde Servants who are creditors
for their weges, and the Fiscus which has a claim for arrears.

2. Privileged Hypothecary creditore, i. e. the Fiscus, the wife for
her dower, and any creditor who lent money for the purchase or
conservation of the subject ol hypothecetion, e. g. to buy the land
or build the house, or build, or buy, or equip the ehip, that ie
hypothecated.

3. Simple hypothecary creditors, who have priority according to
the date of their mortgage.

4. Privileged chirographury (merely personat) creditors, or credi·
tore unprotected by mortgage. Privileged are creditors who lent
money lor the repair of a house; for the purchaee, construction, or
equipment ola ship; or depositors of money, without interest, in
the hands of the insolvent ae banker (argentarius, mensularius).

5. Unprivileged personat creditors, savigny, § 374; Vangerow,
