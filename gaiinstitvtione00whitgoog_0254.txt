1 123. 'nhc praeterition 01 snus heres, another circumstance which
as well as testamenti factio affected the validity 01 a will, was at civil
law critical both at the time 01 making the will and at the time 01
the testator’s death and in the interval: but in later times this
defect 01 1 will was healed by the praetor, who granted juxta-tabulae

The necessity 01 disinheriting 1 suus heres 11 gmunded 01 the
principle of primitive law, that the child is coproprietor with the
parent: hence, unless something occurs to divest the child 01 his
property, he will simply become sole proprietor by survivorship on
the death of his father. Dig. 28, 2, ll, ‘In selfsuccession we have
a still more striking instance of an unbroken continuity 01 1101111101,

occasions no acquisition 01 new property by inhen'tance, but only an

Hence, even in the absence of testamentary institution, a 10111110-

its historic origin, not probably in 1 perception 01 its manifold
utility, but in the primitive form 01 the will-a proposal, perhaps in
the form 01 11 adoption, laid before the legislative assembly 101· its
