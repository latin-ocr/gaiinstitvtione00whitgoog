the central station of his fortunae, and the headquarters cf bis
dealings and dispositione: Incolae vero. . . domicilium facit. Et
in eodem loco singulos habere domicilium non ambigitur, ubi quis
larem rerumque ac fortunarum suarum summam constituit, unde
rursus non sit discessurus, si nihil avocet, unde cum profectus est,
peregrinari videtur, quo si rediit, peregrinari jam destitit, (lod. 10,
40, 7. ‘Home ie identical with Domicil3 and Domicil is agreed to
be the place where a man bas established his houeehold gode and
the headquartere oi his transactione and obligatione: the place
which he will not leave except ior a special purpose; absence from
which makes him seem to be abroad, aud return to which makes him
s cease to be any longer away from home! Sed de ea re constitutum
esse (respondit), eam domum unicuique nostrum debere existimari,
ubi quisque sedes et tabulae haberet suarumque rerum constitu·
tionem fecisset, Dig. 50, 16, 203. ‘It is undisputed that a mau’s
home is the place where he is settled and hae hie countinghouse
(account-books) and the basis cf his operatione (or, centro of gravite-
tion of his fortunee).' In exceptioual cases a pereon'e domicil might

iorum3 that is, in any action in which a man was defendant, the·
plaintiff had the election whether he would sue him at hie forum
, originis or forum domicilii. A party to an action can only be
governed by one Lex: and if he was citizen in any municipality,
he was, generally speaking, governed by lex originie; if he was
nowhere citizen, his relatione may be governed by lex domicilii.

The subversion of the Roman empire in the west abolished the
importance of the Municipalities3 and, with the exception of
Switzerland where it etill prevaile, the doctrine of Origo disappeared
from those countries which are still influenced by Roman jurie-
prudence. Traces ol the Roman doctrine of Domicilium still survive,
at least ae to Forum and Lex, in the Privato internetional law oi

some states: what related to Munera shared the fate oi the other

political institutione of the empire. Savigny, §§ seo-359.

We may observe that the reason assigned by Ulpian for the
incapacity oi Dediticiue to make a will, his want of patria, requires
