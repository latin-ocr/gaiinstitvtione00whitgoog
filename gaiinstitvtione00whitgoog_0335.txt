the bonorum possessio of the praetor, whereby in detatdt of any one
eluiming by a valid civil title, the nearest blood relation, or cognate,
was put in the position of heir. Under these praetorian rules of
inheritauce, at least when they were not simply confirmatory oi the
civil law, cf. 528, both successio graduum and successio ordinum
were possible. J ustinian, however, abolished the rule of the civil law
itself, and allowed a devolution through the degrees oiagnation, on the
ground that, as the burden of tutela devolved through the degrees of
agnation‚ there ought to be a corresponding and compensating develu·
tion ot the advantages of inheritance,1nst 3, 2, 7. This change, how·
ever, was deprived of importunos by the subsequentNovella, 118, which
consolidated and amended the law ot inheritance,discardingthe agnatio
principle of the old law, and substituting ior it that by cognatio.

t 13. The moment at which it ie ascertained that the deceased is
intestato will be separated by an interval from the moment of his
decease, especially when the intestacy is caused by an heir instituted
in a will not accepting within the time of cretio or by his subsequent
repudiation or incapacity, or by the failure oi the condition on which
he was instituted. In this interval the nearest agnete may die, and
a remoter agnete become the nearest agnata. lt therefore was
necessary to determine whether the title of nearest agnato is acquired
at the moment of decease or ot ascertained intestaey; and the latter
moment was selected. Ii the death of the testator had been selected,
then, if the nearest agnete died in the interval, there would be no
heir; neither the heir oi the deceased, as the right to enter was
strictly personat, nor the then next agnete, as proxumus, the word
used in the Twelve Tables, excludes successio graduum: nor the
gentiles, as the words(si adgnatos nec escit) exclude successio ordinum.

514. The limitation, in respect of females, et title by agnation
to iemales who were agnates in the first degree (consanguineas) was

not contained in the Twelve Tables, but introduced by the restrictive
l interpretation of jurists following the analogy oi the lex Voconia

allowed females of remoter degrees of agnation to succeed in the
order of cognatas in delault of heire by title of egnatium but
Justinian totally abolished the limitation, and restored the rule
