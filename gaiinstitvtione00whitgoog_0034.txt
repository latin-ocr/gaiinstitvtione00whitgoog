xxviii HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION

no sufficient evidence for this view, and it seems safer to conclude
that, while every holder of land was registered in the tribe in which
his allotmsnt lay, every landless man was registered in the tribe in
which he had his domicile. At a later period registration became
more arbitrary, and had little or nothing to do with the residence of
the person registered. The censor enrolled individuale in tribes at
his pleasure; usually he entered aman in the tribe to which his
father had belonged3 but he might, if he willed‚ transfer him from
one tribe to another (tribu mouera).

In an assembly organized by tribes (tributim) the vote oi the
majority of the members ola particular tribe determined the decision
oi that tribe, and the vote oi a majority of the tribes the decision of
the asssmbly. The Comitia Tributa Populi must have been
instituted later than 471 a. c, which is the traditional date at which
the Plebs began to meet by tribes¹ ; and it may have been in existence
some twenty years later, at the date of the formation oi the Twelve
Tables¹. The first tevidence for it as a legislat' 1ve assembly belongs
ιο the year 357 a..³.c In the later Republican period it was
probably quite the most active οι the legislative assemblies of the
whole pecple.

The Comitia Curiata, the oldest oi all the Roman assemblies,
'whose structure was based on the ancient Curiae or Parishes of
Rome, ceased in the historiccl period ιο be atrue legislative assembly.
It met only lor the performance oi certain formal acts, such as the
leo ιιιήαιο which ratified the Imperium οι the highsrand the Potestas ’
oi the lower magistrates ⁴. For this purpose the thirty Curiae were
in Cicero's day often represented by but thirty lictors 3. The
assembly may have been as scantily attended when it performed the
formal acts vested in it when it met as the Comitia Galata 3. In this

l

(ii, p. 406) that Appius Claudius, the censor oi 312 nc, first included the
landless citiusne in the tribes (cf. Girard, Manael, p. 31); but our authorities
(Diod. xx. 46, Liv. ix. 46) only represent Appius Claudius as allowing citizens
ιο be registered where they pleased‚ and aa spreading the lower classes (humilier)
ov er all the tribes. The delini tion which we possess of the Comitia'lr ibuta
(Laelius Felix ap. Gellv xv. 27) speaks οι ιι onlyas an assembly at which the
votes are given‘ ex regionibus et locis.¹

¹ L v ii 56. Previouely it had probably met by Curiae. Hence the tradition
that the early tribunes swero elected' ιιι the Comitia Curiata (Liv. i.,c. Cic. ap.
ΑιιιοιιᾹι οισοιιιιιαιιρ. 76).

¹When the Tables enacted‘ De capite civis nisi per maximnm comitiatum

.ne ier unto¹ (Cic. deien' rii. 4. 11),this mention οι the‘ greatesto co misia*
(ie. the Comitia centuriata) seems ιο impiy the existence οι a lesser Comitia
with judicial powers; and the latter could scarcely have been the Comitia
Curiata oi the period.

to those with Imperium, see Messala ap. Gell. xiii. 15. 4 ‘Minoribus creatis
magistratibus ιιι but1s comitiis magistratus, sed justus curiata datur lege!
