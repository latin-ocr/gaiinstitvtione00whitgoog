condition operatos an immediate transfer of possession and a future
transfer of ownership contingent on, and contemporaneous with,
the fulfilment of the condition. Tradition, coupled witha Reso-
lutory condition, operatas two transfers of ownerehip: an immediate
transfer of ownership and a subsequent retransfer of ownership, .
contingent on, and contemporaneous with, the fulfilment of the
condition. The retransfer of ownership follows without any
retradition or reconveyance by the interim proprietor; and the
remedy of the original proprietor is not condictio, implying the
necessity of reconveyance‚ but vindicatio, implying that he is
already reinvested with ownerehip. The jueta causa or disposition
which accompanies the tradition and determines the transfer of
ownership (2 §201 also limita the duration of the ownership so trans·
ferred. Such at least is the doctrine of the majority of jurists:
others hold that the fulfilment of the resolutive condition only
imposes on the transferres a personal obligation of reconveyance.

Conditions annexed to contracte have the following difference
from conditione annexed to testamentary dispositione and disposi-
tione translative of dominion. Conditions annexed to contract are
retroactive: the obligation determined by their fulfrlment relatos
backward and dates from the date of the eontract. Conditions
annexed to legacy or to alienation are not retroactive: the obliga·
tion or ownership thereby conferred only dates from the fultilment
of the condition.

ἕξ 100-103. As tc the rights conferred or obligations imposed by
a contract on third persons not parties to the contract Paulus lays
down the following principle: Quaecunque gerimus, cum ex nostro
contractu originem trahunt, nisi ex nostra persona obligationis
initium sumant, inanem actum nostrum efficiunt: et ideo neque
stipulari neque emere vendere contrahere, ut alter suo nomine recte
agat, possumus, Dig. 44, 7, 11, i.e. in every contract the right created
by the contract must primarily vest, if the contract is tc be valid, in
the promisee himself ; and the obligatior in the promisor himself,
for Roman law did not, it must be remembered, admit the principle
of contractual agency. This rule is evidently not violated if the
promisee associates to himself his heir, ie. contracta for some right
to himself and heir: Suae personae adjungere quis heredis personam
potest, Dig. 45, 1, 38, 14: but it is violated if the promisee contracta
for some right to vest exclusively in his heir, or, as expresaed in this
paragraph, for some performanee post mortem suam. Such contracta
accordingly were void, whether they belonged to jus civile or the jus
gentium, ξ 158. This led to the introduction of an Adstipulator
when a person wished to stipulata something exclusively for the
benedt of his heir, 5 117. When J ustinian abrogated the rule and
