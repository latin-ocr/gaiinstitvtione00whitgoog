signification here3 for the opposition between destruction and
obstruction, avoidance and counteraction, is irrespective oi the
opposition, between jus civile and jus praetorium. In a case of
avoidance, the plaintiff's claim may be derived not from jus civile
but from jus praetorium, e. g. in actio institutoria, ξ 71, hypothecaria,
publicisne: and in a case of counteraction the defendant's ples, as
we have seen, may be derived not from jus praetorium but from jus
civile, though such a plea or exception originated and was principally
allowed by the praetor for the purpose oi giving effect to grounds
of defence which vvere not recognized by strict law. Of. Sohm § 53.

Ipsum jus as contrasted with exceptio denotes the totality of
the conditions comprehended in the intentio-the totality of the
elementa, positive and negative, that constitute the plaintiff’a right:
in which definition positive clemente are the conditione which call
a right into existence; negative elements are the absence oi any
circumstance which could extinguish an existent right or dismies it
into non-existence. Exceptio, on the contrary, denotcs something
external to the sphere of the conditione of existence oi the plaintiff's
right; denotes the existence of an independent adverse right of
the defendant Actio ipso juro nulla will denote a right null and
void by the conditione contemplated in the intentio and frequently
expressed by the word oportere: ectio exceptionis ope infirmata a
right defeated by conditione external to the intentio. The words:
ipso jure, then, might be paraphrased hythe words: si intentionem
tanturn spectes 3 or treated as equivalent to: ipsius jure or actoris
Jure.

The first mode oi defense mentioned above denies the existence of
one oi the positive constituent elementa of the plaintiff’s right.

The second mode denies the existence oi one of the negative
constituent elementa of the plaintiff’s right

The third mode alleges a countervailing right, vested in the
defendant, and generated by a title exter-nal to the sphera of the
conditione which constitute the right oi the plaintiff as expressed
in the intentio.

In some cases the partition which separatos avoidance (ipsum jus)
from counteraction (ope exceptionis) will be extremely thin, and
will consist in some arbitrary appointment of positive law. E. g.
litis contestatio in judicium legitimum produced avoidance, while
litis contestatio in judicium imperio continens only produced counter·
action, 35 181.

Some extinctione (ipso jure) of a plaintiff’s right, where we might
have expected only counterpoises (ope exceptionis) or countar rights
of a defendant, arc to be explained by the fact that there was
a period when Roman procedure did not recognize Exceptions-
