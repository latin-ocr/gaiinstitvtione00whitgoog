unduteous-inofficiosum. A will is destitutum, ‘cum ex eo nemo
heres extiterit’§ 144. A will may be revolred or ruptured by a sub· ·
sequent will, but not by a ecdicii. The 1111113111 or destruction ο1
a will does not revolre it, unless this 11 done by the testator ‘animo
revocandi’ Soet 151‚comna The innovatione of Justinian changed
the effecte of adoption. Under his enactment‚ 11 1 child is adopted
hyan ascendant the old rules obtain3 but a person adopted by a
stranger only acquires rights in the adoptive family in case of
the adopter’s intestacy, and therefore need not be instituted cr
disinhcrited hythe adopter3 he retains, however, hie rights in
his natural family, and therefore must be instituted or disinherited
in the will of his natural parent. 1 §i 97-107, comm.

§139- By English law the only circumstance by which 1 will is
avoided (besides revocation, cancellatim, executiones a later will)
is the marriage oi the testator, and this operatos universally‚ irre-
spectively ottho birth of children. Marriege without munus, which
was usual in the time oi Gaius, had no effect on e will.

ξ 140. This was reversed before the time of Justinian, ior we find
in Dig. 28, 3, 18 that the institution of the future adoptive aon sares
a will from being ruptursd by adoption. Indeed, considering that
the objectos tho lex Vellaea was to save wills from rupture, we may
be surprised thet the extension 11 its provisions from the natural
postumi to the artificia] postumi or quasi postumi had not been
established in the days oi Gaius
