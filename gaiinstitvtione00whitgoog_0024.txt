xviii Ι HISTORICAL INTRODUC'I'ION

earliest times, by the King and the College of Pontifices. Justice could
only be obtained by a litigant who knew the formularies 01 101101,
precise verbal accuraoy in which was necessary 101 the successful
conduct 011 suit ¹. But this knowledge could beobtaiued only 11011
the Kin g and his Pontiffs. 'Phe King, too, must have given the ruling
in law which determined what form 01 action should be employed ¹.
Even at this early period the private J udex 01 Arbiter 1111011011

have been used 101 the 11111 settlement 01111111’; but the King must '

have assisted in his appointment; and his judgment must have
been conditioned by the preceding form 01 action which the King
and the Pontiffs had thought appropriate 10 the suit.

The change from Monarchy to Republic could have made little
differenee in the manner in which the law was revealed 10 the
Roman litigant, except in so 111 as this change may have increased
the power 01 the Collega 01 Ρο111111. The annual tenure 01 the
consulship, and the fact that each occupant of this office was
hampered by a colleague, preveuted the new magistraoy, which was
supposed to give the forms of J us, 11011 exercising over its skilled
advisere the authority which had been once wielded by the King;
and the patrician aristocracy, each member 01 which might be a
consul 01 1 pontiff, must now have attained a solidarity which it had
never known before. 'Phe tendency 01 this aristocracy was 10 close

up its ranke and 10 assert a monopoly, not only of office, but 01 ·

knowledge ,01 the forms of 1111.

17. Patricium oud Paccium.

Had Rome beon a homogeneous community‚ there would perhaps
have been no agitatior 1011110 revelation 01 the principles 011111
which underlay the forms 01 procedure, and there would therefore
have been no tendency towards an early codification. But Rome
was composed 01 two communes, not 01 one. There was a Plebs
within the Populus; and this Plebs possessed a solidarity which
gave it the means 01 lifting up its voice in 1 demand, not for power,
but 101 the protection 01 legal rights and 101 the knowledge which
was essential to that protectior. The origin 01 the Plebs is wholly
unknown. The favonrite assertion 01 modern writers, that the
Plebeians were a alass which had emerged from aconditiou 01 client
ship to the Patricians, does very little to solve the problem of the
origin 01 the former class, except 11 10 lar as it suggests that some 01
the Plebeians were inhabitants 01 conquered cities that had been
deported 10 Rome, aad that others were voluntary sojourners 11011
