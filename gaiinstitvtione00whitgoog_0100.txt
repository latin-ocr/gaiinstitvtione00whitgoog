We read 11 J ustinian's Digest: Qui hominem occiderit punitur non
habita differentia cujus conditionis hominem interemit, Dig. 48, 8, 2.
'l‘he punishment was generally capital, Dig. 48, 8, 3, 5. Itis 10 bs
remembered, however, that 1018 01 these lawe deprive the master
01 the right of punishing his slaves himself 101 domestic offences.
Hadrian prohibited the castration 01 a slave, 001801111301 101001·

protected slaves against oruelty and personal violation, Dig. l, 6, 2,
obliging the master, as we 800 by 1110 text, 10 manumit them on

under the protection 011110 law, and almost recognizing in slaves

that slavery, though an institution 01 jus gentium, was a violation
011110 law 01 101118. Servitus 881 constitutio juris gentium qua
quis domino alieno contra naturam subicitur, Dig. 1, 5, 4. Ulpian
says the same: Quod attinet ad jars civile, servi pro nullis habentur,

homines aequales sunt, Dig. 50, 17, 32. ‘Before the Civil law a
slave is nothing, but not before the Natural law; for in the eye 01
Natural law all men are equal.' 'l'he belief in a Natural law, 111010

But though a Roman slave was incapable of being 11108181 with
