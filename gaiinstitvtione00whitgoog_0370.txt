civil procedure should be in the hands of imperial officials. It was
indeed by the extraordinaria and not by the ordinaria cognitio of the
praetor that levying execution by pignoris capio was first instituted.

Under the empire ordinary execution (Pignoris capio) was differen-
tiated from bankruptoy proceedings (Missio in bona). In Pignoris
capio the court (not the creditor) was put in possession, and the
sale took place in two months, unless the debter paid before that
period. In real actions the res was delivered by the court to the
plaintiff ; ie. the court had acquired a new faculty of transmuting
property from the defendant to the plaintiff. Only fiscal debtors
and insolvents were now subject to loss of freedom, and thie was
no longer incarceration, but only custodia militaris, surveillanoe by
a soldier. Pignorie capio (special Real exception) was followed by
a sale by auction (licitatio, subhastatio) conducted by apparitores
Praetoris. Whereas under the early law creditore obtained Missio
in bona before proof‚ and had subsequently to prove their claime
against the universal successor (bonorum emptor); under the latest
law only those creditore who had proved obtained Missio in bona,
and then received their percentage not from the universal successor
but attho hande of the judex, immediately from the Massa the
proceeds of the sales by a curator; privileged creditore receiving
first their whole claime, unprivileged equal percanteges (aequalia
portio pro rata debiti quantitate). Two years were allowed to
creditore in the same province, four years to creditore in different
provinces to prove their claims; alter which they retained their
claime against the debtor, but not against the possessing creditore.

The following observatione may serve to supplement the brief
remarks of Gaius on the subject of Insolvenoy:

Banlrruptcy prcceedings are a form cf execution, and therefore
belong, not to substantive law, but to the law of Procedure. 'Phis
branch of law, however, as we have already noticed‚ hae some clemente
which are not purely formal, but material, and as such are rightly
admitted to a treatise on substantive law. Insolvenoy ie placed
by Gaius in this part of his treatise, because in hie day insolvenoy
occasioned a transfer ofa universitas, which was a succession to an
entire property.

Proceedings in Insolvenoy may be divided into two portione, of
which one is (A) preparatory, and the other (Β) final.

(A) The preparatory portion includes the Proof of their debte by
the several creditore; the collection of the aesets or formation of the
Masea3 and its eale The collection of the assete includes, on the
one hand, the recovery back of property that has been aliened in

fraudem creditorum ς and, on the other, the elimination or separa·
