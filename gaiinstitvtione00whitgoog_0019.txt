exereised by delegating their authority to a personel representative.
The further right which they possessed in later times, of succeeding ’
to intestato inheritances in the lest resort1, was >perhaps a right
proffieseed by individual members of the corporation rather than by
the corporaticn itself. But a corporate activity far greater than thia
has been suspected for earlier timos. There isindirect evidence that
all Privato Lend (Ager Privatus) was at one time owned by the
Gentes, not by families or individuale ², and the view that the
primitive Roman &nete was in some way representative of the
Gentes is in accordance with the belief oi Romen antiquity⁸. The
fact that the primitive Romen State was in many ways conditioned
by ite clan organization seems to be certain. Aa the State grew
stronger, it substituted the Pamily for the Glen. Between the two
there is only a difference of degree The Family (Femina) ie the
aggregate of the members ofa household under a common head, the
Paterfamilias3 whereas the (lene is the aggregate of all individuale
who bear a common name and who, therefore, if their ancestry
could be traced in the male line through all its stages, would be
found to be the descendants of some ultimate common ancestor.
But the Familia is a far smeller, and therefore a far less powerful,
unit than the Gens. It cannot so effectively dominate the State or
impede its activitiee ⁴. Again, the heads of semilies are many in
number; the heeds of the (lentes (who must have existed at the
time when the Gens wea the important unit) were necessarily few.
The State which deals with families deals with a multitude of
individuale, not with en oligarchy representing the interests of a
number of corporations The conception of individual rights, in
their modern senae, was, it ia true, never fully recognized in Roman
Private Law. It was impeded by the Patria Potestas-the life-long
power of the father over the son. But much was ultimately done to
leesen the rigour of this patriarchal rule; and the principles of
Roman Law were finally extended to raoes which knew nothing
of the Patria Potestas This law ultimately gave the most perfect
expression hitherto witnessed by the world of rights which were
both universal and individual. The existence of the Empine gave
Rome the power, possessed in as high a degree by no other State, of
dealing with the individual on universal lines, because she was not
mpored by the barriers between man and man thrown up by
aepfflte natione] institutione. Δ
