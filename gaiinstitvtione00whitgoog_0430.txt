5141. After the time of Gaius, a constitution of Diocletian and
Maximian (an. 286-305), conformably to the opinion of Proculus,
declares exchange or barter to bea contract, requiring delivery of a
thing to make it enforccable, Ood 4, 64, 3. ‘An agreement ιο
exchange without part execution cannot support an action.’ Ac-
cordingly, we have mentioned it as belonging ιο the miscellaneous
class of contractus innominati.

The obligation of the vendor was not to transfer quiritarian
ownership (ut rem emptoris faciat), but merely to secure the vendee
in undisturbed enjoyment (ut praestat habere licere) of the article
sold, that is, ιο give him vacant possession and gustantes him
against eviction. Accordingly, if the vendes is judicially molested
in his possession, he summons bis vendor ιο defend his title, and,
if evicted, recovers against his vendor the loss he has sustained.
Venditor si ejus rei quam vendiderit dominus non sit, pretio
accepto, auctoritati manebit obnoxius, Paul. Sent. rec. 2, 17, 1..
‘A vendor, not owner, on receipt oi the purchases-money is liable
as warrantor.’ Auctoritas est actio pro evictione, Dig. 21, 2, 76.
‘Auctoritas is an action on eviction against the vendor.'

A sale was often accompanied by stipulatione binding the vendor
ιο repay twice the perchusa-money in case of eviction, or in case
the article sold was returned for unsoundness (duplae stipulatio).
English law implies a condition that the seller of goods has a right
to sell and a warranty that the buyer shall have quiet enjoyment,
but except in certain circumstances refuses ιο assume an implied
warranty oi the goods or soundness of the articles sold, applying the
maxim caveat emptor. But by Roman law, in the absence of such
stipulatione, warranty of the title and quality of the goods was held
to be inherent in the contract of sale. In the case of faults of quality
the purchaser could, by the edict oi the curule aediles, either recover
part of the purchase-money by actio quanti minoris, or rescind the
contract by actio redhibitoria

By English law mere inadequacy of price affords no ground ior
setting asido a sale, unless it be so gross as to afford a necessary
presumption oi fraud and imposition, and then a court of equity will
grant relies. By Roman law a vendor could, under a constitution of
the Emperor Diocletian au. 285, rescind a contract for the sale
oi land on proof that the purchasemoney was only half the velue,
unless the buyer is williug to make the price justum, (lod. 4, 44, 2. ᾗ

Peculiar ιο the English law of sale is the provision of the Statute ⁴
oi Fraude, that contracta for the sale oi lands aro unenforceable
unless they are in writing signed by the party to be charged or
his agent: and, by the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, ξ 4, contracte for
the sale oi goods oi the velue of 210 and upwards are not enforee ,
