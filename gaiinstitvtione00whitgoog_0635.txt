testator; in other words, when it is contended that a disposition, in
consequence 01001110 exceptional circumstance, 1100 1101 the validity
which the law presumes3 1110 01001 01 this avoiding allegation is on
the defendant, cod. 6, 36, 6. Bethmann·Hollweg, 0 109.

111 the middle ages the true exceptio or counteractive ples was
called exceptio juris: the first line of defence, when it assumed the
form efen avoidance, and the second line 01 00101100, whatever its
special nature, were called inappropriately exceptio facti. This shows
11101 the true nature of exceptio had been forgotten: the similanty,
however, 01 the three lines of defense in respect of the burden of
proof is probably the 1000011 why they were all called exceptio.

'Phe necessity in order to save the plaintiff from being taken by
surprise 01 disclcsing by the pleadings whether the defendant relies
on the first or second line 01 defense, 0. g. whether he denies that a
debt ever existed, or maintains 11101 11 was extinguished (for which
diselosure there was no provision in procedure by formula), is probably
the reason why the second line 01 0010110000 well as the third has
been treated as an exceptio (Einmde) in modern Germany. (cf. Civil-
prozessordnung (146, 276), though in the Burgerliches Gesetzbuch
the word ‘Einrede ’ 10 used exclusively 101 01000 constituting the third
11110 01 00101100, pleae constituting the second line of 00101100 being
called ‘Einwendungen' (see 202 (2) and 334, 404, 417, 774, 784, 796).
The terminology of the B. G. B., 00 111110 indicated, was, we are
informed, deliberately adopted by 110 authors

'Phe distinction between counteractive and destructive pless does
not seem to have had much influence on English pleading. Stephens
in his Commentarios, V. 10, admits that all pleas 010 1101 necessarily
either trsverses 01 01000 111 avoidance ; 0110, as 011 instance 010 ples
that falls under neither class, mentions pleae by way 01 estoppel.
One species of estoppel, 00100001 by record, is the Roman exceptio rei
judicatae: so that 11010 we find recognized a third class 01 ples under
which we might have expected that other everments analogous 10
other Roman exceptione would be ranged. We find, however, the
01000 01 the statute 01 limitatione (prescription) and 01 001011 (com-
pensatio) given as instances of pleae in discharge, 10 01 what we have
called the second 1111001 00101100, 01 pleas in avoidance. [Eor the
general theory 01 Exceptio, 000 Savigny, §5 202, 203, 226-229.
According to the prevalent opinion 01 111010 recent writers the use 01
the exceptio is not confined 10 cases in which the defendant may be said
to have 0 counteracting or countervailing right, as our commentary
following Savigny supposes, but 1100 0 wider application. cf. Keller,
Civil Process, 1 34, 11. 368, 0110 the literature there cited]

I proceed to notice some 01 the points incidentally mentioned by
