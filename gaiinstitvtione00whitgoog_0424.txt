employment of this transscriptio. He relatas how a purchaser was
defrauded bya vendor, and in consequence of the form of eontract
had no redress. Stomachari (lanius. Sed quid faceret? Nondum

formulas, De Off. 3, 14. ‘The purchaser was indignant, but he was
helpless, for my colleague Aquilius had not then invented the action
01 Fraud' It may occur to us, on hearing the story, that as the actio
Empti was an action ex bona fide, that is, one in which the judex
was empowered to consider allegatione 01 bad saith, the defrauded
purchaser would not have been without a remedy. But, as Savigny
points eut, Oicero had guarded against this objection by a certain
feature which he gives to the narrative. Emit home cupidus et
locuples tanti quanti Pythius voluit, et emit instructos. Nomiaafacit,
negotium conficit. ‘The purcheser was eager and rich, he bought at
the price the seller named, and he bought the gardens ready furnished.
The contract is by expensilati03 the business is concluded.’ Nomen,
which sometimes signifies any debt, is here used, in a specifie sense,
for a debt created by Literal eontract; accordingly, nomina facit
implies that the purchase, as soon 00 concluded, had been novated,
§ 176, i.e. extinguished by metamorphosis into a ledger debt ; so
that the transaction was removed from the domain of equity to that
01 civil law, which in its primitive simplieity had ne provision fer
dolus malus.

Transseriptio a persona in personam was the substitution or

B to A3 or, at all events, the substitution 01 C in lieu of B as
debtor to A. Transscriptio would thus afferd a ready means 01
transferring obligations from one person to another, especially when
the parties were at 0 distance. It is impossible to form 00 exact
conception of the mode in which these transcriptione were operated
without 0 greater knowledge than we possess of the Roman method
of book-keeping. Nomen facere, as we have just stated, is to contract
a debt by literal obligation. Nomen signifies the name 01 the debtor,
as in the line 01 Horace: Scriptus nominibus certis expendere
nummos; ‘Recorded on his ledger to lond moneys to solvent bor·
rewers! In the business 01 bankers (argentarii), whose book-keeping
01 course was extremely regular, the Literal contract appears to have
survived when it had fallen into desuetudo in other quarters.

The word Trausscripticia may refer to the transfer involved in
Novation: Savigny, however, prefers the following origin of the
term. The Roman account-book (tabulae accepti et expensi), he
supposes, was essentiallya Gash·book; 0 record of incomings and
