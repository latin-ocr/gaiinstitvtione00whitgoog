duplicity of the interdicte was, ae we shall presently see, to increase
the number of stipulatione in the proceeding by Sponsio.

In the system of statute-process (legis actio), Vindicatio is framed
in the form of a judicium duplam The contention of the defendant
was not merely a negation of the plaintiffs claim, but also an
affirmation of the defendant's claim, acontravindication. Praetor
interrogat eum qui cedit an contra vindicet, 2 ξ 24; cf. 4 § 1.6. It
was not necessary that the oross claime of the parties should be
identical in character. On the one eide there might be a claim of
status, on the other of property, one party vindicating as free the
person whom another claimed as slave : or one party vindicating the
frcedom of a person whom another, as transferes of patria potestas,
claimed to be his bondeman (mancipium); or one party asserting
the independence (sui juris) of a person whom another claimed as
filius familias or as subject to patria potestas, cf. 1 ξ 134.

Similarly under the legis actio procedure Hereditatis petitio,
3 ξ 32, comm, would probably be in the form of judicium duplex3
for Hereditatis petitio is a species of Vindicatio.

Vindicatio and Hereditatis petitio are related to the actions Gom·
muni dividundo and Familiae herciscundae ae wholes to parts: the
former lay claim to integral ownerehip and integral succession
where the latter merely claim partial ownership and partial suc-
cession, Inst. 4, 6, 20. The former became judicia simplicia in the
later system of law, while the latter remained judicia duplicia.

In English jurisprudence both parties are said to be equally
. plaintiffs and equally defendente in the actions called Quare impedit
and Replevin.

Uti possidetis was sometimes judicium simplex. We may dis·
tinguish three applicatione of this procedure:

(ι) When both parties claim to be in actual possession and one
of them is found to be truly in possession without having acquired
it from the other by violence, secrecy‚ or permission. Uti possidetis
is then really an interdictum Retinendae possessionis

(a) When the possession of the actual possessoris found to be
vitiated by violence, secrecy‚ or permission, he is displaoed, and the
non-possessor ie reinstated. Uti possidetis is then in substance and
effect interdictum Recuperandae possessionis. In both of these cases
it is judicium duplex.

(3) Uti possidetis might further be brought against a defendant
who made no contentiori that he himself was or ought to be in
possession, but who was guilty of some disturbanoe or molestation
of the possessor3 e. g. by prohibitio: Qui colere fundum prohibetur,
possidere prohibetur, Dig. 43, 17, 3, 4. Eum qui aedificare pro·
