ξ 3. Negativa. Au action respecting a servitude was either Gon·
fossoria or Negativa. If the plaintiff claimed a servitude over the
land or home of the defendant, his action vvas called confessor-im
ifhe denied that his own land or house was subject to a servitude,
his action was called Negativa (or Negatoria) in rem actio. In
confessoris the intentio was of the form, si paret Aulo Agerio jus
esse eo fundo quode agitur uti frui: in Negatoria of the form, si
paret Numerio Negidio jus non esse eo fundo dequo agitur uti frui
invito Aulo Agerio. In this action the plaintiff, probably, was not
bound to prove a negative, but only tho existence of his own
ownership; it would then be incumbent on the defendent to prove
affirmatively a limitation of this ownership. The actio negatoria is,
it must be remembered, maintaiuable by the owner of property, not
only when some one claimsaservitude over it, but also in the case
of any other interserente with his rights, short of actually depriving
him of possession. It is, like vindicatio, an actio in rem based on
title of ownership, so thatin bringing it, it is incumbent on the
plaintiff to prove his ownership, which is a proverbially difficult
subject of proof.

The coexistenoe of actio confessoris and actio negatoria with the
antithesis of Positive sud Negative servitudes is at first sight
embarrassing: for we might suppose that an actio Oonfessoria of
a jus altius tollendi was equivalent to an actio Negatoria oi a jus
altius Non tollendi ; and that an actio confessoris oi ajus altius Non
tollendi was equivalent to an actio Negatoria of a jus altius tollendi :
so that the law would be sucumbered by a redundancy of forms

The following appears to be the explanation and to reconcile
statements in our authorities which st first sight ara inconsistent.
The nature of the Servitude, Positive or Negative, alleged by the
plaintiff and, consequentially, the characteres the action, confessona
or Negatoria which he instituted, depended on the nature of the
facts on which he relied as his title and on the nature of the allega·
tions by which the defendant opposed his claim.

The plaintiff asserted a right of raising the height of his house
by an actio confessoris of a jus altius tollendi, consistently with
the statement in ξ 3, if he alleged the Extinction of a former jus
altius Non tollendi, ie. the recovery of his original freedom3 for
we have mentioned, 2 § sl, comm, that the extinction of an Urban
servitude could only be accomplished by the erection of a contrary
or antagonistic servitude: whereas he asserted it by an aetio
Negatoria of a jus Non altius tollendi, consistently with Dig. 8, 5,
4, 7 (competit autem de servitute actio domino aedificii neganti
servitutem se vicino debere), if he denied that such ajus Non altius
tollendi hadever existed.
