'Phe J us Gentium could not pass from being a mere fact to being
an ideal without geining some theoretical justification for its existence
and acceptance. This justificetion was found in the idea that it was
a produot of the Law ofNature. It is not improbable that the
superior ‘naturalness’ of the J us Gentium to the J us Civile had
begun to appeal to the Romans long before they had begun to be
affected by Greek philosophie thought; for we know the effect which
was produced on the minds of the Greeks themselves by their early
contact with foreign civilizationa They rapidly drew the conclusion
that what was common to various countries existed by nature (φύσει),
what was peculiar to a country existed by convention (νόμῳ); and
the κοινὸς νόμος1 or τὸ φυσικὸν diruaov' of the Greeks is practicully
identical with the Jus Gentium of the Romans. Even to the
primitive mind the universality of an institution implica its natural·
nese. But it is very probable that the Stoic conception oi Nature
did, to the Roman mind, complete the train oi thought and give
a scientific stability to a vagno impression. It was not, indeed,
possible to identify the Jus Gentium with the Lex Naturae, for a
J us cannot be the same as a Lex. But it might be regarded as the
produet of that Lex, as its concrete expression in human society.
The immediate product, however, of the Lex Naturae is the Jus
Naturale. The Jus Gentium tended, therefore, to he identified
with the J us Naturale; and the identification seems to be complete
except in one important point. According to tho view finally adopted
by the jurists, the Jus Naturale implies personal freedom; for all
men are born free in astate of nature³. But the J us Gentium (the
law of the civilized world) admits the institution oi Slavery. In
this point, therefore, the two are in conflict, and the Jus Naturale
presente an even higher ideal of society than the J us Gentium. The
relation between the three types oi Jus, known to the theory of

Roman jurisprudence, may be expressed by saying that the Jus
Civile is the Right of man as a member of a state, the Jus Gentium
the Right of the free man, the J us Naturale the Right of man ⁴.

The appeal to Nature on behalf of the slave is an index oi the
part which he was to play in the development of Roman law.
Roman slavery cannot be judged solely either by the dismal picture

thejae civile studied the interests only oi citizens, and the Jus ymnum those of
