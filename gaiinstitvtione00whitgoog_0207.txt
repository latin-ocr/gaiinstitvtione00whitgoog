simple non-user (non utendo) on the partof the dominant property for
a period, originally, cf two years, afterwards of ten. The extinction
of an Urban servitude demanded, besides the negative omission of
use on the part of the dominant,a positive possession of freedom
[usucapio libertatis) on the part of the servient owner. Gaius (ad
Edictum Provinciale, Dig. 8, 2, 6) thus explains the differenee: in
a servitus ne amplius tollantur aedes, or ne luminibus aedium
officiatur, if the windows oi the dominant house are closed with
mascnry there is a non-usus of the servitude on the part oi the
dominant owner; if at the same time the height of the servient
house is raised there is possession oi freedom on the part oi the
servient owner. Or in a servitus tigni immissi, ii the dominant

η owner removes the beam from his neighbour’s wall there is on his

part non-usus; if the 'servient owner builds up the critice in

J which the beam was inserted, there is on his part usucapio liber·

tatis. Originally servitudes, like Dominium, could be acquired by
Usucapion; and as Usucapion was applied to the extinction ol Urban
Servitudes, it was regarded by the jurists as a mode of acquiring or
of creating an antagonistic servitude. On the extinction of a Rural
servitude, the servient property simply recovered its original dimen-
sions: an Urban servitude was a permanent diminution of the
servient property, and on its extinctio'n the servient property, instead
oi dilating to its original siae, recovered what it ,had lost in the shape
of the annexation of a contrary servitude. When at an unknown
date the Usucapicn ol servitudes was abolished by a lex Scribonia,
an exception was made in favour of these Contrary servitudes, which
in fact were not genuine servitudes, but merely the expression of the
greater difficulty of extinguishing an Urban servitude. Libertatem
servitutium usucapi posse verius esti quia eam usucapionem sustulit
lex Scribonia, quae servitutem constituebat, non etiam eam, quae liber·
tatem praestat sublata servitute, Dig. 41, 3, 4, 28. ‘Thebetter view is
that extinction of servitude by usucapion is admissible, for the usuca·
pion abolished by the lex Scribonia was usucapion whereby a servitude
is constituted, not that which liberates by extinction of servitude.’
Thus he who laboured under a disability of building (jus altius non
tollendi) was regarded on its extinction as having acquired the oppo-
site easement, jus altius tollendi; he who was relieved of the servitus
ne luminibus officiatur was regarded as acquiring a jus officiendi
luminibus vicini; he who was relieved from the servitus stillicidii
avertendi in tectum vel aream vicini was deemed to acquire a jus stil-
licidii non avertendi, Gaius ad Edictum Provinciale, Dig. 8, 2, 2. It
dces not appear that the ordinary requisites cl Usucapio, titulus and
bona fides (5 61, comm), were required in this usucapio libertatis.

In usucapio libertatis, a right being acquired, the ten years are
