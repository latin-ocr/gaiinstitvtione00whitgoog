A disciple and colleague 04 Papinian, 04 Syrien origin, who like·
vise became praefectus praetorio, was Domitius Ulpianus, murdered
hythe praetorian soldiery‚ whose domination 110 resisted, in the
praeence 04 the Emperor Alexander Severus: 2464 fragments, eom·
posing about a third 04 the whole Digest, are 401101 from his
writings. An epitome of his Liber Singularis Regularum is still
extant in a manuscript 04 the Vatican Library, and is the work
referred to when, without mentioning the Digest, we cite the
authority 04 Ulpian.

Another disciple and colleague 04 Papinian was Julius Paulus, 04 ’
whose writings 2081 fragments are preserved in the Digest, forming
about a sixth 04 140 mass An epitome ol his treatise called
Sententiae Receptae is found, with the Epitome 04 Gaius, in the
code 04 Alaric II, king 04 the Visigoths3 and it is to this book that
we refer when we simply cite the authority 04 Paulus.

A disciple 04 Ulpian’r was Herennius Modestinus, of whom 344
extracta are contained in the Digest. Alter Modestinus the lustre 04
Roman jurisprudence began to decline. (Fora detailed account 04 the
Roman jurists, see Roby's Introduction 40 the Digest, chs. vi-xvi.)

Besidee the sources 04 law enumerated by Gaius, the Institutes
04 Justinian (1, 2, 9 and 10) mention Custom or Usage‚ the source 04
consuetudinary or customary law (jus non scriptum, consensu
receptum, moribus introductum). To this branch 04 law are
referred, with other rules, the invalidity 04 donatione between
husband and wife, Dig. 24, l, 1, the power 04 a paterfamilias to
make a will 401 his filiusfamilias ⁴who dies before the age of puberty
(pupillaris substitutio), Dig. 28, 6, 2 pr, and universal succession in
Goemption and Adrogation, 3 t 82. See also 4 §i 26, 27. We may
suppose that customary law, 11110 Roman law in general, would fall
into two divisione, jus civile and jus gentium, the former embracing
what Roman writers sometimes speak 04 00 mores majorum. Before
the 4111004 Gaius, however, most 04 Oustomary law must have been
incorporated by statute, as in early times by the law 04 the Twelve
Tables, 01401101 up into 4110 011104 044110 praetor 01 the writings 04 the .
