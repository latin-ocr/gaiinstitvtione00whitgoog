1v.§§88—102.] DE SATISDATIONIBVS 531

In the time of Gaius, if tha defendant in a real action refused ιο
give security judicatum solvi, the possession was transferred from
him to the plaintiif by the interdict Quem fundum, Quam here·
ditatem, or Quem usumfructum, as the case might be, and he was
reduced at least for some pmposes to the position of plaintiff; cf. Ulp.
Inst Fragm. Vind. in Kmeger, J us Antejus. 2, 159, ‘Some inter·
dicte may either initiate or restore possession, as the interdicis Quem
fundum and Quam hereditatem. Foris I sue a person for land or
an beritage, and he refuses to give security, he is compelled ιο
transfer the possession ιο me whether I never before had possession,
or once had and afterwards lost possession ’3 and Ulpian, Fragmenta
Vaticana 92, ‘'I'he plaintiff has a right to security in a real action for
a servitude as well as for a corporal thing, and therefore, analogous
to the interdici, Quem fundum, there is an interdict, Quem usum·
fructum, for the transfer ofa usufruct’3 cf. also Paulus, Receptae

Sententiae, 1, 11, l, ‘In a demand of a heritage, security must be
given, or else possession is tramferred to the demandant If, how·
ever, the demandant refusa to give security, possession remains with
the possessor, for in equal circumstances law favours the possessor!
(tf. Lenel, 5248. 2, ng.

'l'he same principle may perhaps also have applied ιο Praedial
servitudes. If A asserted against B the Urban servitude altius non

tollendi (si ageretur, jus vicino non esse, aedes altius tollere), i.e. sought
by actio Confessoria of jus altius Non tollendi (with an intentio,
perhaps, in the following form: si paret jus Numerio Negidio non esse
aedes altius tollendi invito Aulo Ageriol to restrain B from exercising
the indefinite powers of ownership by raising the height of his house,
Bmight decline ιο defend the action and thus avoid a judicial decision
as ιο the existence of the servitude3 but asa penalty fo'r this he
would not be allowed afterwards ιο exercise his alleged right without·
first proving before a tribunal the nullity of A's claim; proving,
that is, either that A never had such a servitude over his house,
or that he, B, had extinguished it by acquisition of the counter·
servitude (libertatis usucapio). That is to say, being ortginally in
possession, or rather quasi-possession of the jus altius tollendi (for
servitudes are not, strictly speaking, subjecta of possession), B was
deprived oi this position ς and, ifhe afterwards wished ιο exercise his
right of building, had first to recover possession of it as plaintiff in
a suit: ie. by actio Negatoria of jus Non altius tollendi, if he denied
that A as dominans ever enjoyed such a servitude, or by actio
Confessoria of jus altius tollendi, if he claimed as serviens ιο have
reacquired the freedom of his house by usucapio libertatis

rl'he penalty would only consist in an inversion of the order oi
proci: Β as plaintiff would have ιο provehis own proprietorship
