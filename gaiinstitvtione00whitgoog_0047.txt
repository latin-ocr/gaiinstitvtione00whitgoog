REFORMS IN PROGEDURE xli

what form the alternative was presented. We know that the
law must hare exempted certain kinds of jurisdiction from the
llornrula-the jurisdiction, for instance, of the centumviral and
Decemviral courta But it may hare allowed the Praetor tc
substitute the one procedure tor the other in most spheres oi civil
jurisdicti0n; and, where the Praetor still permitted the Legis Actio
and the Formnla to stand side by aide in his Album, it may hare
giren the litigante a choice between the two. The two methods of
prunedum still exist side by side in Cicero’s time; but the formulary
procedure is demonstrably the more general of the two.

About the time when this reform was being effected, an attempt
was made tc create a methcd ot criminal procedure, simplet and
more effective than that of a trial before the People. The type
on which the new criminal courts were constituted was furnished in
the main by civil Procedure Oases of extortion (Repetundarum),
in which compensation was demanded for a delict, were first tried
before a Praetor and Recuperatcres. This was amere provisional
arrangement initiated by the Senate sor the benefit ol the provinciale ¹.
But the system, or one closely modelled on it, was perpetuated by
the Lex Calpurnia Repetundarum of 149 ac. ¹, and gradually these
recuperatorial boards grew into great panels of J udices, the qualifica-
tiens for the jurors being specified by judiciary lewe (Leges Judi·
einrico). Finally‚ almost the whole sphere of the criminal law was
embraced by a series cf enactments which created standing courts
{Quaestionea Perpetua, cr Judicia Publica), each for the trial ot
a special offence or a group of related crimes. All of these ccurts
followed the same model In each e President (Quaesitor), who was
generally a Praetor, set with a bench of Judices who pronounced
apenalty lixed by the law which had constituted the court. From
the jndgment cf these J udices there was no appeal to the People.

'Phe change from the Republic to the Principate introduced no
very sudden alterations in the sources cf law or the methods of
