The criminal law of the Twelve Tables reflecte a moro primitive
stage of thought than its civil ordinances. But this is not sur·
prising3 ior, throughout the whole of Roman History, the criminal
law lags far behind the civil. The Tables recognize the principles
of seli-help and retaliation. A limb is tobe given for alimb ;but for
minor assaults pecuniary compensation is allowed ¹. We still find
the idea oi capital punishment taking the form ol an expiation to an
outraged deity ; thus the man who destroyed standing corn by night
was hanged as an offering to Ceres ¹. The belief in witohoraft still
survives3 for death is the penalty lor incantatione ⁸. It is also the
penalty on the judex who has taken brihes, and ior treason
(Perduellio) in the form of ‘rousing an enemy against the State or
handing over a citizen to the enemy ⁴!

But it is where criminal law touches questions of personal liberty,
and is connected with constitutional law, that the legislation of the
Twelve Tables is most advanced. The principle of the Appeal to the
People [Provocatiol against the sentence of the magistrate was
maintained⁶3 it was enacted that no law or sentence should be
passed to the detriment of an individua} (Privilegia ne inrogantot⁶3
and it was laid down that no capital sentence could be nsued except
by ‘the greatest oi the Comitia' (nisi permaximum comitiatum)';
that is, by the Assembly of the Centuries, or Exercitus, gothered in
the Campus Martius.

An important aspect of the Public Law of the Twelve Tables is
the guarantee oi the right of free association, provided that it have no
illegal intent. While nocturnal gatherings (coetus nocturni) are
prohibited ⁸, the formation of gilds (collegia) is encouraged. Such
gilds were to require no special permit for their existence, and the
rules which they framed for their own government were to be valid‚
provided that these rules were no infringement of public law ⁹.

Lastly‚ the most typical and tmportant utterance of the Tables is
to be found in the injunction that ‘the last command of the People
should be fina ¹⁰! It is an utterance which shows how little the
Decemvirs regarded their own work as final, how little they were
affected by the Greek idea of the unalterability of a Oode, of a Oode
forming a perpetual background of a Constitution—-in fact, by the
idea of a fixed or written constitution at all. It is an utterance that
expresses the belief that law is essentially a matter of growth, and
