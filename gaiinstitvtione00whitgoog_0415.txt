Both Oorreality and Solidarity, as implying liability for entire but
alternative performance, lie in the mean between two extremes: on
the one side, divided or partial (pro rata) liability; and on the other
side, the multiple or cumulative liability, generated by delicte that
give rise to actions for penalties. E. g. if several persons combine
to commit a theit they are all severally liable to the aetio furti for
the whole penalty, and payment by one does not discharge his
follow delinquente: or il a person is guilty of an outrage (injuria)
which wounda the honour of several, they are all creditore for the
penalty, and recovery by one does not extinguiah the claims of the
rest, 3§221. Where the actions on account of an illegal aot are
purely indemnificatory, as the actions brought on account of thelt

for damages-condiotio furtiva-or on account of Metus, Dolus, ,

Noxa, Vis, there, as we have already stated, the relation of Solidan'ty
subsiste between the rodelinquents, and satisfaction by one ea·
tinguishes the obligation of the rest

ThedifferenoesbetweenOorrealityandsolidarityareprinoipallytwo:

1. In Oorreality the right ol action against the remaining co·
debtors or bytho remaining co·creditors was extinguished by joinder
of hene in an action (litis contestatio) against or by one of the
parties: in Solidarity the right of action was only extinguished
by complete payment or satisfaction (solutio). Electo reo principali
fidejussor vel heres ejus liberatur: non idem in mandatoribus obser·
vatur, Paulus 2, 17, 16.

It was possible to avoid the consumption or extinction ol the
right ol action against the surety that was operated by suing the
principal by so shaping the stipulatio of fidejussio as not to produce
Correality, Dig. 45, l, 116. But at a later period the extinction of
right to sue by litis contestatio was abandoned: and Juetinian
expressly enaeted that in Oorreality as well as in Solidarity only
actual satisfaction of a claim should operate a consumption of the
right of action Juetinian’s ordinance is introduced into the Digest
by means oi a bold interpolation: Oum utro velit Seius aget, ut, si
cum uno actum sit ct solutum, alter liberetur. Pomponius, Dig. 30,

ι 2. Α second difference between Oorreality and Sohdarity consiste
in the fact that in Solidarity the guarantor who pays the whole has ›
regressus against his cognorantors, that is to say, has a power
of recovering from them contribution of their share of the debt:
whereas the Oorreal debtor who pays has no regressus or right to
contribution. (I' have here followed Vangerow: Savigny attempts
to prove, but apparently without success, that regressus is an
incident of Correality.) Where, however, the Solidarity is the effect
of codelinquency (No. a above) the delinquent who pays has no
