dinato importance, and though it cannot furnish the distinctions oi
Dominium and Obligation, nor of Public and Privato dominium, yet
bas a considerable influence on jurisprudenee, and demands a certain
amount of attention. 'l'hus ocean, air, and light, as opposed to the
earth. are by their nature essentially res communes. Being in·
capable of appropriation, they have not been appropriated and are
held in communisnn Again, in wild animale, as opposed to tame,
property is only coextensive with possession. On the differenee
between specific and generic things, or things consumed by use,
quae pondere numero mensurave constant, and things not consumed
by use, is founded the distinction between the contracta of mutuum
and commodatum. cf. 3§ 90. On the same difference of specillo
and generic things are founded different rules relating to the eon·

sometimes come under discussion (cf. Inst. 2, 1, 1 Et quidem

et mare et per hoe litora maris) but are not mentioned by Gaius,
we may observe, that they only fall within the province of positive
law, as belonging to the jurisdiction of each particular state.

All the things within the territory oia given state are subject to
its dominion (dominium eminens), that is, are res publicae in a
general sense of the term. Of these things it allows the dominium
over some to vest in private individuale ior their own advantage,
while it retains the dominium over others in itself as if it were a
corporation or collective person (personarum universitas). This
gives us a division of all things into res privatae and res publicae
in a narrower sense of the term. We must note, however, that the
dominium of the state is not exaetly similante private dominium,
that is to say, is not dominium in the proper sense or the sense in
which the word ia used in civil law. For the civil dominium of
private persons is a right protected end sanctioned by a political
superior, whereas a sovereign state is by hypothesis in subjection
to no superior. Aetate, then, can only be said to have dominium
in a modified sense oftheword, thetis, sofaraeitianotrestrained
by any positive law of any superior irem using and dealing with
