1 civile may be freakish and caprioious, while that in jus gentium may

1 be reasonable and expedient3 but both are equally positive institu-
tione, and both are equally mutable and liable 10 be overruled.
Accordingly, the specioueaounding maxim, that revolutione iu status
or civil condition cannot affect such rights 00 are annexed to natural
titles, crumbles away as econ aa we examine it, for we find that it
only holds good 01 the most insignificant change, the minima
eapitis minutio, 3127, andthat maxima and media capitis minutio
extinguiah title by cognatim, which belongs 10 jus gentium, aewellas
title by agnation, which belongs to jue civile. Inst. 1, 16, 6.

Tha truth 10, 1111111110 effecte 01 0 0011101011 01 civil 01111110111101
law fall under two very different classes, which it is important to
distinguieh.

1. 11 1110 command 01 the civil lawgiver, under the away of
motivae linancial, political, ethical, or religione, ie highly imperioue
and absolutely compulsive, all natural 111100 with which it may
come in conflict are absolutely void and inoperative: e. g. the Sc.

1 Velleianum, prohibiting eurctyship 01 women, allowed no naturalis
obligatio to be produced by any such suretyship: and 00 with the
lawe prohibiting gamhling and usury.

5 a. If the command 01 the civil law 10 less peremptory and abso·

1 luto, it may deprive any conflicting natural title of plenary force,

’ 01111 yet leave to it a naturalis obligatio capable of acquiring efficacy

1 by some machinery of positive law; 0. g. 1110 Sc. Macedonianum,

¹ prohibit-ing money 100110 10 a filiusfamilias without the sanction of
his father, made them irrecoverable by action, and yet the courte

, recognized in the borrowing filiusfamilias a naturalis obligatio, which
was capable 01 novation, Dig. 46, 2, 19, and a bar 10 recovery back

¹ (condictio indebiti) in caee oi actual repayment, Dig. 14, 6, 10.

When Juetinian consolidated the law of 1111001010 011001οε1011 and
made the right 01 succession depend ou cognation instead of agnation,
he made a corresponding change in the obligation of guardianehip,
which hencefcrth devolved on cognatee instead 01 agnates, women
