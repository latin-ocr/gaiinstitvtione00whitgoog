Novation naturalis obligatio was placed on a level with civilis
obligatio, Novatio est prioris debiti in aliam obligationem, vel
civilem vel naturalem, transfusio atque translatio, hoc est cum ex
praecedenti causa ita nova constituatur ut prior perematur. . . .
Qualiscunque igitur obligatio sit quae praecessit, novari verbis potest,
dummodo sequens obligatio aut civiliter teneat aut nabrraliter, ut
puta si pupillus sine tutoris auctoritate promiserit, Dig. 46, 2, l.
‘Novation is the mergar and transfer of a prior debt into a subse·
quent obligation, civil οι· natural ; or the destruction of a prior obliga·
tion by the constitution of a new one. Every kind of obligation can
undergo novation by verbal contract, provided that the subsequent
obligation binds either as civilly enforceable or as merely a natural
one, as the promise of a ward without his guardian’s sanction!

t 177. We have already seen an instance of novation when treet
ing of delegatio, tt 155-162, comm, the satisfaction of a debt by

substitution of a debtor. The substituted debtor who discharges ¹

by stipulation the first is called an expromissor, ἕξ 110-127, comm. ς

ξ 178. We see by Justinian, Inst. 3, 29, 3, that the addition or
omission ofa fidejussor was finally held to operate a novation.

ξ 179. Servius Sulpicius was wrong because novation implies
a subsequent obligation, but a conditional obligation is really no
obligation until the condition is realized. So if the prior obligation
is conditional and the second obligation absolute, the novation is

not absolute but conditional, because there is really no prior obli· ¹

gation until the condition is realized, at which moment novation
takes place, and the prior obligation is extinguished.

J ustinian, on account of the frequency of disputes aa to whether
the parties had the intention of novation, anacted that no contraot
should operate a novation, unless the stipulating parties expressly
declared their intention that such novation should be produced, Inst
3, 29, 3α; cod. 8, 41,8.

ξ 180. errs oonrnmnrm, J oinder in issue, or tha settlement of the
issue to ba tried by the judex, denoted, under the system oi statute
process, when pleadings were oral, the close of the proceedings in
jure, when, the praetor having allowed an action, each party called
those who were present to attest the nature of the issue allotted
to be tried. Festus. ‘Contestation is when both parties exclaim,
‘⁴ Give your attestation.'’ It marks the definitive settlement of the
issue to be tried' Under the fonnulary system the term was still
employed, but marked the moment when the praetor delivered the
written formula containing the commission of the judex. Under
the third period of the law, when the praetor or highest judicial
functionary was himself the judex, that is, no longer delegated the
causato a judex privatus, but either heard and determined it himself
