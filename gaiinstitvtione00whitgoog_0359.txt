11111 55-76.] DE BONIS LIBERTORVM 299

we have seen that, in the absence 01 patria, a man’s personal
capacity was to some extent determined by his domicilium. It may
be, however, that the equivalence 01 domicilium 10 patria did not
necessarily extend to testamentary capacity. The modern maxim:
Locus regit actum, 4 § 53, comm, the ability of even temporary
residente, as opposed 10 domicil, to give validity to the mere 10111
01 a disposition if made in accordanoe with the law prevalent there,
is not a recognized principle 01 Roman law itself.

The third alass 01 freedmanship (dediticia libertas) had long been
obsoleto when it was formally abolished by Justinian‚ an. 530,
00110. ’

The second class (latinitas), under which the freedman relapsed
into servitude at the moment 01 death, was also offensivs to Roman
feelings in imperial times, and was formally abolished by lastiniam,
the principal modes of creating latinitas being transformed into

modes 01 acquiring quiritary status or civitas Romana, and the
remainder being deelared imperative, Ood. 7, 6.

The rules 01 1100001101 10 intestata ireedmen of the first class,
the only class henceforth recognized, were immensely simplified by
Justinian. While he abolished the last remnants of the lex Papia,
and amongst them the rights which that law·gave to the' patron
against the heritage 01 centenarius, or the freedman who died worth
100,000 sesterces, or what Justinian treated as equivalent, 100
aurei, he confined the rights 01 the patron te inheritances 01 that
amount, thetis to say, he exempted from the claime 01 the patron,
contra-tabular or ab intestato, all estates lest bya freedman below
1110 velue 01 100 aurei. Against such estates as remained liable,
moreover, he reduced the claims, contra-tabular or ab intestato, 01
the patron from ᾖ 10 ὲ.

Ρ111011 were protected against fraudulent alienations by the freed·
man in his 1110111110 11 two ways Alienations which reduced the
fortune 01 the freedman below the specified limit (made the freed·
man minorem centenario) were deemed 10 be in fraudem legis, and
were ipso jure null and void: alienations which, without making
the freedman minorem centenario, diminished the amount 01 the ὲ
to which the patron was entitled, were valid 11 law, but were
rescinded by the patron’s action against the alienes. 11 the
freedman died testate, the patron employed against the alienee

¹the formula Fabiana; if he died intestate, the formula Calvisiana.
These actions were analogous 1ο the actio Pauliana, the creditors’
remedy in the case 01 alienations in fraudem creditorum. Fraudulent
alienations by manumission, whether in fraudem creditorum erin
fraudem patroni, were made null and void by the lex Aelia

Sentis, 1 137.
