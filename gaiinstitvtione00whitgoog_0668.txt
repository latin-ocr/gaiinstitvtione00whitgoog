s second in jus vocatio, or reappearence in jure in pursuance of tha
vadimonium, at which the parties entered into five different
stipulatione.

Just as interdict procedure was necessary in order to determine
which litigant should haye iuterim possession pending the vindicatis
so it was necessary to determine who should have interim possession
pending a possibly protracted interdict procedure. This was aecem·
plished by means cf Fructus licitatio, which took place in the second
appearance before the praetor, and was followed by either (a) the
Fructuaria stipulatio, or satisdatio judicatum solvi.

Each party then wagered a penal sum in two characters, for each
party was both plaintiff and defendant: and, aa a sponsio was s
unilateral contract, in order to produce a bilateral contract, thetis,
to bind both partios and constitute a single bet or wager in tho
modern sense of the term, it was necessary to have two stipulatione,
that is, a sponsio and a restipulatio. For the purpose, therefore, of
making two wagers the parties entered into four stipulatione (two
sponsione and two restipulations); i. e. (b) one sponsio and (c) one
restipulatio in which a litigant was promisor and promisse as
plaintiff, and (d) a second sponsio and (a) a second restipulatio in
which he was promisor and promisee as defendant The sponsio
would be a stipulation to the following effect: Si adversus edicbrm
praetoris possidenti mihi vis a te facta est, tot nummos dare spondes?
Spondeo: the restipulatio to the following effect: Si adversus edictum
praetoris possidenti tibi vis a me facta non est, tot nummos dare
spondes? Spondeo. Thereby each party would bs bound to pay, or
entitled to receive, two penal sums, according as the actions brought
on these four stipulatione decided the issue which the stipulatione
A judex was then appointed who tried the four actions.

Then if the victor in the four actions had not been the higher
bidder at the Licitatio, the judex decided a fifth and sixth action:
namely one called judicium Secutorium or Cascellianum, which had
a formula arbitraria, and whereby possessiones the movable or
irnmovable and its fruita was recovered from the higher bidder; and
another on (a) the Fructuaria stipulatio, to recover from the higher
bidder a penal sum equal to the velue of the fructus.

Instead of suing on (α) the Fructuauia stipulatio the victor hed the
option of bringing judicium Secutorium for the recovery of this penal
sum, and then he was protected against the event of his opponent’s
insolvency by sursties (satisdatio). It may he selred what com·
pensating disadvantage of this course should ever induce the victor to
auson (a) Pmotuaria stipulatio. Perhaps, as Krueger suggests, if he
sued for the penal sum by Secutorium with satisdatio, then when he
