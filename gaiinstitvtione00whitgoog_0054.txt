kept the Princeps in touch with the whole provincial world, and
caused him to be regarded by the provinciale as the greatest and
most authentis interpreter of law. 'Phe Edicta, Decrees, and Rescripts
came to be described by the collective name oi ‘Imperial Consti·
tutions’ (constitutiones Principum), and by the time ot Gaius they
were held to possess, in auniiorm degree, ‘the binding force of

Mandatum. This was a general instruction given to subordinate
officials, for the most part to governcrs of provinces, and dealt
usually with administrative matters, although sometimes it had
reference to a point of law. Such mandates might be, and often
were, withdrawn by the Princeps who had iseued them, or by his
successor. Hence it was impossible to attach perpetual validity to
their terma. But, when a mandate dealt with a precise point of law,

and was renswed by successive emperors, it must have acquired the
force oi a Rescript ⁸.

given to all jurisdiction other than that oi the ordinary civil and

its chief characteristic was that the cognizancelcognitio), both on the
questiones law and on the question oi fact, was undertaken solely by
the magistrate or by a delegate nominated by him (judex extra
ordinem datus)⁸. In civil matters, the Princeps sat as such au

in matters such as 'Prust or Guardianship. He might take other
