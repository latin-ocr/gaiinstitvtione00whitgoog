be rebutted by any other proof of his sanity exeept proof 01 the
adequaey 01 tha motivas for which 1110 ohild was disinherited. 'Phe
querela inofficiosi was a form of petitio hereditatis, that is, a real
aetion, and fell under the jurisdiction of 11100011111111111000114531.
cf. Pliny, Ep. 5, 1; 6, 33. The amount 01 the share which must be
1011 10 a child 10 save a will from avoidanoe for inofficiositas bears
some analogy to a requirement of the lex Falcidia, for it is identieal
with the amount which that law secures to the ohild or any one else
when instituted heir as against the olaims 01 legatees. The querela
inofficiosi oould not only be brought by a ohild but also by certain
other near relatives, namely‚ parents, aud by brothers and sisters,
but by the last only 11 a turpis persona was instituted. Childnen
and other near relatione, even though emancipated, might be entitled
to this remedy. See Inst. 2, 183 Dig. 5. 23 Cod. 3, 28.

(3) Although a ohild (01 any one else) were instituted heir, yet tha

’ institution might bo made illusory by the exhaustion of the whole

inheritanoe in legaoies, leaving nothing to the heir but the burden of
administration. 'Po meet this, the lex Falcidia provided that when
more than three fourths 01 an inheritanee is absorbed in legaoies, all
the legaoies should abate proportionably so as to leave the heir a clear
fourth of the portion in whioh he was instituted (quarta Falcidia), t 227.

(4) The senatus consultum Pegasianum provided in the same way
against the inheritanoe being similarly exhausted by fideioonrmissa,

We may add that an impubes adopted by adrogation, ifdisinherited
or without cause emancipated, was entitled to one fourth of the inheri-
tanoe of his adoptive father (quarta Antonini), 1 t 102 ; Inst. 1, 11, 3.

t 157. Communism 01 eoownership appears to be an older iusti·
tution than divided 01 individual ownership. Even after the rights
of the paterfamilias had been enormously developed at the expense
01 the rest of the household, as may have been the osse in prehistorie
times, a vestiga 01 the times when property vested rather in the
family than 111 the chief was perhaps preserved in the rules 10-
sperting the suus 110100. Suus heres appears equivalent to sibi heres,
and implies that he who now enters ou proprietary rights in the

. oharaeter 01 paterfamilias had already possessed proprietary rights

over the same subject-matter in the oharaoter 01 filiusfamilias.

Less barbarous than aelf-suooessor (the 101111 01100011 10 represent
suus heres as expressing sibi heres) but 100 long 101 perpetual use,
would have been the circumlocution, immediate lineal suooessor.
