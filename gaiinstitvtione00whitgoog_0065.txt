Ι idel-7] DE IVRE GENTIVM ΕΤ OIVILI 3

Ι of the political sovereign, and the implied, indirect, circuitous enact·
ments imported by the sovereign’s acquiescencs in the ruling of
subordinate authorities. (See Helland's Jurisprudence, chs. 2-5.)

'l'he rules and principles denoted by the terme praetor-made ΙΝ,
juristmade law, judgemade ΙΝ, are only ΙΝ because they are
impliedly adopted, confirmed, and ratified by the silent acquiescence

ιΙ of the sovereign.

The organ by which the jus gentium of the Romans was pro·

Ι· mulgated, which made it by indirect enactment a portion of Roman

, Positive law, was principally the Edict of the Praetor. 'Phe rela-

ἵ tiens of Roman citizens with aliens (peregrini), that is, with the
members of foreign states formerly subjugated by Rome and now
living under the protection of Romm ΙΝ, as well as of aliens in
their intercourse with one another, became, about 242 sc, so
frequent as to be made subject tc the jurisdiction of a special
minister of justice called Praetor peregrinus, who, like the Praetor
urbanus, publishcd an annual edict announcing the principles on
which justice would be administered. These principles composed
jus gentium as opposed to jus cividm. Jus gentium, that is to say,
was not really, as Roman jurists imagined or represented, a collec-
tion of the principles commento the legislation of all natione, but
a body of rules which the Roman praetor thought worthy to govern
the intercourse of Roman citizens with the members of all, originally
independent‚ but now subject, foreign nations.

Gradually the rules originating in this way were extended to the
intercourse of citizens with citizens, in cases where the rigorous
conditions of jus civile were not exactly satisfied, and so precepts
of jus gentium were transferred from the edict of praetor peregrinus
to the edict of praetor urbanus.

The portion of the edict most fertile in principles of jus gentium

, would be the clauses in which the praetor announced, as he did

i in some cassat that he would instruct the t,judex whom he appointed
to hear and determine a controversy, to govern himself by a con·-
sideration of what was aequum et bonum,1.e by his views of
squity and expediency: and if any of the oral formularies of the

, earliest system of procedure (legis actiones) contained these or

Ι equivalent terma, such formularies may be regarded as a source

ρ of jus gentium. It may be observed that Gaius does not, like
some other Rommr jurists and notably Ulpian (cf. Dig. l, l, 1, 33
Iust. l, 2 pn), make any distinction between jus gentium and jus

Γ naturale. 'l'here is nothing in bis writings, as they have come
down to us, to draw attention to the fact that the teaching of
nature may not be in accordance with the practice of natione, as
the institution cf slavcry shewed.
