except 1010 suit! A minor who had a curator could not aliene
without the consent 01110 curator: he could incur an obligation
without the consent 01 110 01110101, subject to his right of in
integrum restitutio, though, unless he had coutetur, persons would
nothe very willing to contract with him. Even the existence 01
0 curator did not depr-ive the minor 01 110 right 01 restitution, but
01 course it could not be obtained so readily as when he acted
without the advice 01 a curator. The praetor allowed actiones
utiles against a curator, corresponding to 11000 10 which a tutor
was subject.

The tutor and curator were entirely separate iunctionaries: when
women were under perpetual tutelage, a woman might have both
a tutor and a curator. The curator 01 0 minor must 10 dis·

certain rights and duties, which will be explained when we examine

How exactly the lacuna in § 197 should be filled up 10 doubtful.
We do not know what ie the previous passage referred 10.

Besides minors, lunatice and prodigals 01 whatever age were
committed to the charge 01 curatore. The cura 01 1111101100 and
prodigals 10, indeed, older than that 01 minore, being regulated by
the Twelve Tables, which directed that the nearest agranta should
be curator 01 0 lunatio, and manage the 001010 01011 interdicted
prodigal. In later times it was usual for the praetor or praeses pro-
vinciae to appoint a curator after inqucst (ex inquisitione). Paulus
has preserved the form 01 words in which the prodigal was inter·
dicted: 3, 40, 7. ‘By eustom the praetor interdicte a prodigal
from the administration 01 110 property in the following terme: As
thy profligacy is wasting the estate of thy father and ancestors,
and bringing thy children to destitution,I therefore interdict thee
from the control 01 thy patrimony, and from all disposition 01
property.'
