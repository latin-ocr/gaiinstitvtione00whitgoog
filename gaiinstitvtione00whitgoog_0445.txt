111. §blm-162] DE MANDATO 385

ξ 162. It is only when the property of the mandator is antrusted
to the mandatarius, such as in the cases here mentioned, that the
contract of mandatum can fall under the head of Bailment.

The gratuitous character of mandatum was often in later Roman
law rather nominal than real. The professor of e liberal art (operae
liberales) could recover a remuneration which, however, was dis·
guised under the name of salarium or honorarium, and could not be
suad for by action of mandate before an ordinary judge, but was a
matter for the extraordinarycogniaance of the praetor or governor of
a prosince. Adversus eum cujusnegotia gesta sunt, do pecunia quam
de propriis opibus vel ab aliis mutuo arreptam erogasti, mandati
actione pro sorte et usuris potes experiri. De salario autem quod
promisit, apud praesidem provinciae cognitio praebebitur, uod. (Emp.
Severus and Antoninus) 4, 35, 1. ‘The person whose business you
transactcd, as to the moneys out of your own pocket or taken up at
a loan which you spent for his use, may be forced by action of
mandate to raimburse you the principal and interest. Butae to
the salary which ‘he promised this is a matter falling within the
jurisdiction of the president of the province.' Under the liberal pro·
sessione are included advocates, physicians, oculists, aurists, dentists,
copyists (librarii), notarios, accountants, school-masters, narses, rheto-
ricians, grammarians, geometers, land surveyora The professore of
philosophy and of civil law may receive foss voluntarily offered, but
their functione are so exalted that it would be unseemly in them
to ask for a pecuniary remuneration even at the tribunal of the
praetor, Dig. 50, 13, 1. On the other hand, payment for services
of an inferior kind (operae illiberales) could be enforoed by actio
locati.

The law of contractual agency was, as we have seen, only slowly
developed in Roman jurisprudence. Originally the cases in which
one person could bind another person by his contracte were confined
to contracte made under certain circumstances by persons under
power, that is to say, sons or slaves.

A right acquired by a son or slave was acquired for the father or
master, l ξ 163, and when an obligation was enforceable by one of the
actiones adjecticiae qualitatis, the father or master, or principal, could
be suad upon it, 4 §§ 70-7 4. But in other cases the benefit or burden
ofa contract was oonfinsd to the parties contracting. The procurator
or agent contracted with a third party in his own name: the third
party recovered his dues from the agent by an aetion on the contract:
and the agent would in turn recover his from the principa] by an
action on the mandate. There was no immediate relation between
the third party and the principal, and any action in which the third
party sued the principal errice versa, could bave only resulted from
