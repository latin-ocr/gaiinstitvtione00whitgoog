ξ 61. Compensatio or cancelling 01 crosa claime by setting 011 one
against another (compensatio est debiti et crediti inter se contributio,
Dig. 16, 2, 1) was originally limited to claime 01 the partios growing
out 01 the same ground (ex eadem causa, 5 61), hence there could be
no setoff in an action for enforcing a unilateral obligatioir3 but the
transaction must be one that generated either a bilateral obligation
and gave to both parties an actio directa, er g. emptio venditio-or
a semi-bilateral obligation,¹ giving to one party actio directa and to
the other actio contraria, e. g. commodatum. In other words, Gom·
pensatio was not possible in actions stricti juris, such aa condictio,
but confined to actions bonae fidei. The emperor Marcus Aurelius
allowed Compensatio to be urged against claime based on transactione
that could only generate unilateral obligations, and sc made the
identity 01 title (eadem causa) unnecessary: in other words, he
admitted Compensatio in condictiones or stricti juris actiones. (It
was merely by inadvertence that Justinian in ‘compiling his own
Institutione out 01 those 01 Gaius 'retained the words ex eadem causa
in the definition 01 Compensation, Inst. 4, 6, 39. Savigny, 5 45.)

In an actio bonae fidei, to which it had been previously limitedy
Compensation 01 the defendant’s counterclaim cx eadem causa would
not require to be commanded by' an exceptio deli, but would be
included in the officium judicis3 i. e. could be made hythe judex if
it seemed good to him (cf. § 63 as newly deciphered by studemunu
11601000 cst tumea judici author omuiao inuicem compensationis rationem
’ tabae) in virtue of the terms nx sous rm'n contained in the
formula which gave him his commission. In an actio stricti juris,
aiter the rescript 01 Marcus Aurelius, the judex could be obliged
to make compensation by the Exceptio Doli mali, but only if the
exception was expressly inserted in the formula: sed etin strictis
judiciis ex rescripto divi Marci, opposita doli'mali exceptione, com·
pensatio inducebatur, Inst. 4, 6, 30. The effect 01 this change seems
tc have been t'o establish Compensatio for the first time as a definite

right 01 the defendant, which the judex must allow him to make use ¹

of, and this may possibly be the meaning oi the 'much controverted
phrase ‘ipso jure compensari,' Inst 4, 6, 36; Dig. 16, 2, 21; eod.
4, 31, 14. Of. Dernburg, Geschichte und Thecrie der Kompensatiom
p. 3103 Pandekten, ᾗ 62, 11010013,ν 14.

The exception was of the form: siin ea re nihil dolo malo Auli
Agerii iactum sit neque fiat, ξ 119: and wc find in the Digesta
definition 01 Dolus that seems intended to apply to a claim fo'r (roma
pensation: Dolo facit qui petit quod redditurus cst, Dig. 44, 4, 8.

Some writers hold that this exceptio empcwered the judex, not tc
maire compensation but simply to give judgment against the plaintiff
on the ground 01 his making what according tc the principles 01 bona
