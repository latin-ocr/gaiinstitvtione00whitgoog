FORMAL ALIENATION 437

(r) Delivery of a thing might be made with the design of merely
transferring Detention Such was its effect in Depositum, Commo·
datum, Mandatum, Leontio. Or, secondly, it might be made with

the purpose of transferring something more than Detention‚ namely
Possession. SuchwssitseffeotinPignusandPrecarium. Or, thirdly‚
it might be made with the intent of transferring Ownership, as in
Donatio, Mutuum, Solutio. Which oi these intentione prompted a
given Delivery might be extremely difficult to prove. The difficulty
vanishes in Mancipation and Surrender before a Magistrate. Their
forms comprehend a most emphatic and trenchant expression oi
intention ‘I essert that this slave is my own’ (hunc ego hominem
meum ease aio) is the exclamation oi the eliense, confirmed by the
assent of the alienor, in both modes oi Formal alienation.

(2) Formless dispositione, whether alienatione or contracte, may
leave a doubt not only which of several intentione governed apro·
cadurs, but whether any intention at all had been matured in the

efficient cause in intention to procures gain. If this was universally
true we might say that all dispositione were in respect oi motiva
bilateral: ie. that in all a pecuniary loss incuned at one stage of the
transaction is balanced by a pecuniary gain accomplished at another.
This holds of all mercantile transactione which are the bulk of those
that occupy the attention oi jurisprudence. The market, however, is
not the whole oi the world, nor are mercenary acts the whole oi life3
and there is such a thing as a disinterested disposition, a disposition
wherein a man incure a loss to which the causa or motor factor is
the intention not of counterbslancing gain in another part of the
transaction, but of pure and simple and unrequited liberality.

Donation may be lound in the sphere either of Ownership or oi
Obligation; it may be accomplished either by alienation or hy
promise ι the intention of liberality may bc consummated either by
