immediately in the state, others in subordinate persons, single or
corporate, magistrates, lor instance, and municipalities, to be held
by such persons for various public purposes. Among these we
might also rselron res divini juris, though as dedicated to religione
purposes, such things were regarded by the Romans as no man's
property, ἕξ 3-6.

Another division of res publicae is into res in patrimonio populi
and res non in patrimonio populi. Under the former aro included
the public treasury, the public domain, public slaves, boqueats
lapsing to the state (caduca) or res privatae otherwise devolving on
the state ; in other words, all things of which the state as universitas

retains not only the property but also the use and disposition (res .

enim fiscales quasi propriae et privatae principis sunt, Dig. 43, 8,
2, 4). The other class includes high reads, public rivers, public
buildings, dre, thetis, all things of which the property is in the
community and theuso in the members of the community. Or
we may say that the property is in the universitas, but it is subject
to a personal servitude (usus) vested in all the private members of
that universitas (singuli, universi).

Not only res publicae but res privatae may be thus subject. For
instance, the banks ol public rivers and the trees thereupon are the
property os the adjacent proprietors; but the navigatore of these
rivers have the right ol mooring, lending, unleding, and using the
banks in various other ways, Inst. 2, l, 4.

Ownership (dominium) absolute or preeminently so called, may
be defined as a right ot unlimited duration, imparting to the owner
a power of indefinite enjoyment or use, and apower of aliening from
all who in default of alienation by him might suceeed by descent;
or, in other words, from all successore interposed between himself
and the sovereign as ultimus heres. It is accordingly sometimes
said to consist of jus utendi, fruendi, abutendi3 where abusus includes
the power of consumption or destruction, ol dereliction, and of
disposition (sale, erchange, gift, mortgage, lease, dac). Another
clement ie equally important, the right of exclusion (jus prohi-
bendi). Another ie the jus transmittendi, ie. the right of leaving
the integral right, in the absence of Disposition, to those whom he
would presumably have wished to be his successore.

. Besides ownership (dominium) Roman law recognizes various
kinds of partial property, real rights everen object ol whichthe
dominium is in another person, called jura in re or jura in re
aliena, rights which fall short ot absolute property but approxi-
mate to it in various degrees. Such rights, which are limitatione
of ownership, are servitudes, ξ 14, mortgage (pignus), super-
ficies, and emphyteusis. These may all be regarded as demcbed
