litigante, the alienes was supposed ιο recover an estate by process of
law. By a l'ine, an action commenced against the alienor and at
onos terminated by his acknowledging the right of the alienae, a
tenant in tail could aliene the fee simple, so far at least as to bar
his own issue. By a Reoovery‚ a tenant in tail could convey an

Ἴ absolute estate in feo. This was an action supposed to be, not like
³ a Fine immediately compromised, but carried on through every
regular stage ιο the conclusion; whereby the alienes recovered '

judgement against the alienor, who in his turn recovered judgement
against an imaginary warrantor whom he vouched to warranty (ol.
laudat meterem, 3 5141, eornm).

Res neo mancipi, thetis all objecta of individual ownership, other
than res mancipi, were the only things allowed ιο pass in complete
ownership (pleno jure) simply by tradition, t 19.

This informal mode of alienation did not, like mancipatio, in jure
cessio, and usucapio, belong to J us Civile, but ιο Jus Gentium, t 65;
