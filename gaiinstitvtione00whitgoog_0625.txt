of a further fact whereby the efficacy of the admitted fact to found
a right was avoided. E. g. the averment of the infancy or lunacy
of a party to a disposition (confession and avoidance of English law,
producing a ples in justification).

11. The averment of a subsequent nullification or nxrrrorror of
the plaintiff's right, admitted to have previously existed (confession
and avoidance, i. e. confession not only of a fact, as above, but of a
right, with an averment of its subsequent abolition, producing a plea
in discharge), e g. the averment of solutio, acceptilatio, novatio.

111. The objection of a colliding right of the defendant, whereby
the right of the plaintiff is not avoided or extinguiahed but counter·
worked or restrained from operation: e. g. resistance to an alleged
right ofa stipulator by putting forward ae acounter right that the
money in consideration of which the stipulation had been entered
into had not been paid‚ or that the defendant had acquired by
informal agreement the right of not being sued on the stipulation
(confession ofa fact or right and, not avoidance but, oouxrnxscrror).
This third mode of defenoe is called Exceptio. Accordingly exceptio
may be rendered aGounteractive or obstruetive, as opposed to a
Negative or destructive, plea

'l'he allegation of an exceptio does not preclude the defendant
from contesting the intentio: Non utique existimatur confiteri de
intentione adversarii quocum agitur, quia exceptione utitur, Dig. 44,
1, 9, and the intentio must he proved by the plaintiff before the defen·
dant is called upon to prove the exceptio, cod. 8, 35, 9: so that,
instead of wgfcseioa and counteraction, the exception should be
described asa supposition or assumption and counteraction of the
plaintiit's right.

1. Examples of the first line of defense are, in areal action, the
negation of the traditio on which a plaintiff founds his claim of
ownership: in a persona] action, negation of the contract or delict on
which the plaintiff founds his claim of obligation: in either real or
persons] action, avoidance of the title alleged by the plaintiff by allega·
tion of the incapacity, as e. g. the lunacy of an alienor or contractor.
In hereditatis petitio, the original nullity of a will is pleaded, or the
plaintiff's testamentary title isavoided, by everment of the preterition
by the testator of a suus heres. A title by contract may be avoided
by indicating a limitation in respect of time or place or condition or
alternative.

In general the grounds of the original nullity of a disposition are
eithert

(a) Want of the conditione necessary to its validity, whether
from absence of the personal qualities required in the dieposer‚ or
from absence of the intention which is of the essence of a disposition
