111. tt los-181] Q. M. OBLIGATIO TOLLATVR 401

defendant, although it commences after litis contestatio, suffices to
render him liable to be condemned. So in the actio de peculio,
the existence of a peculium; in the actio mandati, the existence of
moneys belonging to the principal in the hands of the agent; in the
actio pignoraticia, the satisfaction of the debt by the mortgagor3 all
respectively conditione oia judgment in favour of the plaintiff, render
the defendant liable to condemnatio even when they are events
subsequent to the institution of the suit

The same applies to certain exceptione: in the exceptio divisionis
the question respecting the solvency of coguarantore, § 121, and in
the beneficium competentiae, 4§§ 39-44, comm, the question respect·
ing the means of the defendant is decided according to the circum·
atances in existence at tha moment of condemnation.

3. Litis contestatio has hitherto been considered in respect of its
influence on the Conservation or Destruction of aground of action.
We proceed to ite effect on the Amount of the condemnation or of
the damages to be awarded.

(a) '1¹0 save the plaintiif from being injured by the unavoidable
duration of the suit, without, however, deterring the defendant from ,
the defence of whathe honestly believes to be his rights, a judgment
against the defendant requires him to restore Omnis (lausa, ie. omne
quod habiturus esset actor, si statim judicii accepti tempore res si
reddita flasset, Dig. 6, l, 20, all that the plaintiff would have had if
restitution had been made to him at the moment of litis contestatio.
This implies the restitution of Fluctus, all the gain of whatever
nature that the defendant has derived from the fact of possession. If
the object claimed ie a sum of money, the defendant, notwithstanding
the absence of mora, must pay Interest from the date of litis
contestatio, cf. 2 ξ 280, comm

(b) After litis contestatio the defendant, the bona fide possessores
well as the mala fide possessor, the debtor free from mora aa well aa
the debtor chargeablc with mora, is liable ior Culpa of every kind
and degree, and responsible for the destruction and deterioration
thereby occasioned. E. g. he is liahle for neglected fruita (fructus
percipiendi) es well cs for fructus consumpti and fructus extantes,
for the omission to collect the fruita is a piace of culpable supine·
ness.

(c) Litis contestatio in actiones stricti juris fixes the moment to be
regarded in the valuation of the plaintiff's interest in the subject of
dispute (litis aestimatio). In bonafide actionsthis date isgiven by
the moment of Condemnatio. See 4 §l 45-52, comm.

4. Litis contestatio affects the character of the object of litiga·
tion, which it converte into res Litigiosa, thereby rendering unlawful
its alienation by the plaintiff or defendant. See 4 ξ 117 a
