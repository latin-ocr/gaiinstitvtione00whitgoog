lege Junia prohibitus est3 is autem qui dediticiorum numero est,
quoniam nec quasi civis Romanus testari potest, cum sit peregrinus,
nec quasi peregrinus, quoniam nullius certae civitatis civis est, ut
secundum leges civitatis suae testetur, 20, 14. This requires some
explanation: and the explanation may serve to illustrate all those
passages of Gaius, e. g. 1 ξ 92, where he alludes to the laws of
civitates peregrinae.

At the close of the republic, and during the first centurics of the

empire, all Italy, with the exception oi Rome, was composed of a
number of townships; each with its own territorial limite, and each
possessed of its own constitution, magistrates, jurisdiction, and, to a
certain extent, legislation. In the lex Julia municipalis, preserved
on the tabula Heracleensis, these townships are called Coloniae when
they had been founded as colonies from Rome, Municipia when they
traced their existence to some other origin. 'I'he provinces, though
originally very variously constituted, were gradually assimilated in
condition to Italy and its towns: so that finally the whole empire
was composed ol municipalities, and almost all of its free inhabitants
were either citizens ol Rome or ol some local and inferior com·
munity.
- The generic denomination of these communities, whether Italian
er Provincial, was Civitas or Respublica. 'Phe term Municipium
was sometimes used in this generis sense: but was more commonly
used in a specific sense as opposed to Colonia. Municipes, however,
is often used in the generic sense where we might have expected
Municipium as equivalent to Respublica or Civitas. It is also
often used to signily generically, not a state or juristic person
(municipium), but its individual members; ia as equivalent to
cives, in speaking of any town but Rome: as the word Civis, from
its habitual opposition to Latinus and Peregrinus, had acquired a
tendency to suggest civis Romanus. 'Phe area belonging to each
town was called Regio or Territorium, and included under one juris·
diction all the Vici within its geographieel limita.

(litizenship (civitas, patria, origo) in any municipality was pro·
ducible by four causes: Municipem aut nativitas facit, aut manu·
missio, aut adoptio, Dig. Ad Municipalem et de Incolis, 50, 1, 1, pr.
Cives quidem origo, manumissio, adlectio, adoptio; incolas vero. . .
domicilium facit, cod. 10, 40, 7.

(1) Birth (origo, nativitas) was the commoneat title; and hence
the word origo is used as equivalent to civitas. Children born in
marriage had the civitas of their father; those not so born of their
mother. Some states had the privilege that children born in lawlul
marriage of parents belonging to different communities should have
the civitas oi the mother in addition to that of the father.
