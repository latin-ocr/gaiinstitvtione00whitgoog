extortion: the formula Octauiana or actio quod Metus 0000010100-
duced hythe praetor Octavius, father 01 Augustus, 00. 79 : and the
actio Vi bonorum raptorum, introduced by the praetor Lucullus,
rac. 77, all fall within the space 01 1000 years and indicate the
lawlessness generated by the civil wars 10 110 time 01 Sylla

Robbery, like theft, requires dolus malus, that is, oriminal 10100-
tion. If then a man, believing himself to bs rightful owner, violently
seized movable goods, he was not guilty of robbery,1nst. 4, 2, 1 ς 101,
by a constitution 01 110 emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and
Amedine, enacted 00. 389, 10 order to repress violence, and detsr
people from taking the law into their own hands, a person who
violently seized either movable or immovable property, if rightful
owner, forfeitedthe property to the person dispossessed ; if not
rightlul owner, was condemned, besides restitution of possession, 10
forfeit the value 011110 property, cod. 8, 4, 7. This constitution
increased the civil penalty recoverable for violent dispossession 01
land hythe interdict unde vi, 4 §§ 154, 155. The interdict uude vi
could not originally be maintained for violent, but unarmed, dis-
possession 11 110 person evieted had himself acquired possession from
the evictor by an origin, violent, clandestine, or permissive, unless
the evictor had come armed with weapons of offence: and for either
armed or unarmed dispossession the liability, as iar as the property
in question was concerned, was only restitution 01 possession. By
the constitution 01110 three emperors the civil penalty 01 all violent
disseisin was loss not only 01 possession bnt of ownership; and sub·
sequently to this constitution, the interdict uude vi ceased to make
a distinction between armed and unarmed dispossession.

This constitution may bs regarded as the final blow struck by the
Roman legislator 01 110 archaic form 01 remedial procedure-private
violence or sslf-redress. In archaic society, if society it could be
called, before the establishment 01 0001001 authority, public tribunale,
and police or executive functionaries, such was the only possible
means 01 redress; and such redress was recognized and permitted
by primeval law, if the sentiments of the tribe at suoh a period ean
10 called by the name 01 law.

Among the German races the disorder implied by the toleration 01
Feud 00 private war was gradually mitigated by the introduction 01
0001010 Truces, or temporary or local Peuces : the [truce 01 110 King,
prohibiting private war within the precincts 01 110 royal residence:
the Truce of the Chureh, giving to the fugitive wrongdoer an asylum
in the sanctuary: the 'Pruce 01 110 Assembly, excluding the prosecu-
tion 01 feuds from the place where the Hundred was assembled : and
the Truce 01 110 Town, village, or House, protecting the offender from
homicidal attack within these limits.
