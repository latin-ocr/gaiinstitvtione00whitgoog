ceo ADDENDUM

acquainted‚ does not suggest, ae a motivo or cause of the advantage
conferred on the promisee, any compensating burden that he has
previously borne.

The iunction of marmor contracte, the purpose for which they
were invented, is obviously the facilitation of the Prooi of rights and
duties by meane oi the simplification of their Title. 'lhe more com·
prehensive the conditione of the Title to which a right is annexed,
the more complicated and troublesome will be its Prooi 'I'he causal
iactor of Formless contracts yields to a fraudulent debtor at least as
many positions where he can intrench himself as the sequent factor.
The necessity imposed on the plaintiff in an action on a Formlesa
contract of proving the existence of an adequate cause doubles his
burden of proci ι Abstrect contracte reduce this burden toa fractior.

From the statement, 35 92, comm, that a certain evidence of the
contract is au integral part of Formel but not of Formless contracm
that Formal contracte, in other words, take up into their eseence
a certain preappointed evidence, while Formlees contracta are com·
plote independently oi this, it might be inferred thet the elementa oi
the Formal contracte were more complex than those of the Formlem:
but this would be an erroneous conclusion. ‘Phe admission of evi·
dentiary matter into the essenos oi the Formal or Abstract contrast
is more than counterbalanoed bytho exclusion of the causal factor.
'l'he evidentiary metieris something visible and audible and easy of
proof and adjudicatiou; prescribed, indeed, ior the very reason that
it is so easy ol prooi and adjudication: whereas the causal factor,
involving a question of ulterior as well as of immediate intention,
may furnich scope ior endless subterfuge and controversy.

'Phe validity ol Formal contracte irrespectivc oi the caueal iactor was
to a certain extent infringed in later jurisprudence by the admission
oi the Exceptio doli, more particularly in its form of Exceptio non
numeratae pecuniae. Thus for the space of two years after a cautio
fora loan by stipulation or otherwise had been given, the creditor
who sought to enforce the contrect was under the necessity of proving
the existence oi the cauea (numeratio pecuniae): to this extent, then,
Stipulatio was reduced to the disadvantageous position ola Formlese
contrect, 3 §t 97-109, comm.

Poenas dispositione were not confined to the sphere of contract:
in the sphere oi alienatione Traditio is Formless, while Mancipatio
and In jure cessio are Formal. Forma] alienatione present the earne
contrast that we notioed between Formal contracte. Mancipatio by
its simuletion of a purohcse and the payment oi purchase money
makes the same recognition ol a causcl factor that Nexum and Ex·
pensilatio made by the paymcnt, or fiction of payment of, a loan;
while in Jure cessio (if we can speak with confidenoe oi a process
