ι [φῶ-115 la] DE MANV 69
By manus the husband, or the husband's father, had power of life and

derthorer the wife, Irivy‚39‚ 18 ; Tac. Ann. 13, 32 ; and all the property
of thewife, even more absolutely than by the common law of English
jurieprndance, vested in the husband or hie paterfamilias, 2 ξ 98.
The patriarche of the Roman nation could probably not conceive
af the conjugal union aa disjoined from manus Yet at a very early
period of Roman history these were recognined as separabis, and in
later times they were almost universally dissociatcd, and wedlock
was unaccompanied by manus In a marriage celebrated without
confarreation and without coemption before the expiration of the
first year of cohabitation there was civil wedlook without manus, and
the Twelve Tables provided a method (trinoctio abesse) by which this
state conld be indefinitely prolonged,§ 111: andes soon as gentile
marriagee were recognized by the law the Romane were still more
familiarined with the spectacla of lawful matrimony without manns.
As the agee advanced the wife acquired more and more indepen-
dence; manus was almost obsoleta in the time of Gaius, and it has
quita yaniehed from the legislation of Justinian. (For a detailed
account of the law of marriage see Sohm, pp. ero-498.)
Gonfaneation was a form of marriage which mede tha heus
¹ eligible for certain high sacerdotal functione, and may therefore be
regarded as characteristic of the petrician caste Originally it proh·
ably prodnoed merital power in its full extent ; but when Augustus,
ac. 10, attera vacency of aeventy·five years, renewed the priesthood
of Jove (flaminium diale) he limited by statute the legal effect of
confarreation in that particular instame, ξ 136; and Tiberius, an. 23,
extended the limitation to all future cases o'f confarreaticn, 'fac
Amr. 4, 16. Heneeforth it only operetedachenge of family in respect
of sacred ritae (secula the woman oeesed to have the domestic gods
and domestic worship of her father, and took in exchange the
domestic gods and domestic worship of her husband. But in
secrrlar matters her family was unchanged: she remained if filie
familias, subject to patria potestas, and did not become quasi filia·
familiae in the houeehold of her husband: her old ties of agnation
in her father’s family were not suepped, end no new ties of agna·
tion in her husbend'e family were acquired. Divorce (differreatio,
Festus, av.) was almost impossible, and this indissolubility of the
connexion contributed to the unpopularity of confarreatio. More·
orer, it was a religione ceremonial, requiring the presence of the
pontifex maximus and flamen dialis, and as such it vaniehed with
emishing paganism. The ten witnesees apparently represented the
ten entiae of which the tribe was composed or the ten gentes of
which the curia was composed, or, ifthe decimal division continued

further, the ten familiae of which the gene was composed.
