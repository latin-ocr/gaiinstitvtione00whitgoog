398 DE OBLIGATIONIBVS [111. §t 168-181.

Nor, secondly, did Novatio necessaria, though it extinguished
Civilis obligatio, prevent, like Novatio voluntaria, the continuance
01 Naturalis obligatio, Dig. 12, 6, 60.

Under Justinian Litis contestatio lost half cf its effect: it still
retained the positive 10001100 01 generating 0 new obligation; but
it ceased 10 have the negative 10001100 01 extinguishing 1110 old
obligation. From this time, accordingly, we 0000010 hear 01 pro-
cess-consumption 01 this kind whether extinctive (litis consumptio
ipso jure) as relating to statutory actions, 01 countsraotive (exceptio
rei in judicium deductae) as relating to actions dependent on the
authority 01 the praetor. Indead the former 01 these (litis con·
sumptio ipso jure) had disappeared long before, contemporaneously
with the disappearance 01 legitima judicia; that is to say, with the
abolition under Diocletian 01 the crdo judiciorum (formulary system),
and the transformation 01011 procedure 1010 cognitio extraordinaria.

Gaius attributes a Novative power not only to Litis contestatio,
but also to Judgmsnt (res judicata). Judgment, like litis con·
testatio, has two 1000110110, 000 Negative, the other Positive. By
its Negative operation it extinguishes the previous right 01 action:
by its Positive it entitles, 111 the event 01 Condemnatio, 10 Execu·
tion. The Positive 10001100 10 10 the interest 01 the plaintiff:
the Negative principally in the interest 01 the defendant Under
Justinian the novative effect of J udgment, as well 00 that 01 Litis
contestatio, was considerably altered. It was partly narrowed:
e. g. an absolutiones the ground 01 Plus petitio, 4 ξ 53, 01 010
dilatory exception, 4 ξ 120, 00 longer grounded an exceptio rei
judicatae: and it was partly extended: 101 instance it founded ex·
000110 101 judicatae not only in respect 01 the principal question, but
also in respect of incidental questions, whose decision was pre·
liminary to that 01 the principa] question, and in respect of any
exceptione or replications. In view of these changes it is said that
Res judicata, like Litis contestatio, while it retained its positive
iunctione, lost its negative 1011011000 Βο1 while it still generated
an exceptio rei judicatae it seems difficult to say that it ceased
10 have a negative or consumptiva operation: though this was
attenuated, and made more rigorously subsidiary 101110 positive
operation ; and was henceforth left entirely to the (1100101100 01 the
praetor.

The present seems 10 be the most convenient occasion that we
shall find for gathering together in one conspectus 1110 various
operatione and effecte 01 Litis contestatio: fuller explanatione 01
each will be found scattered over this treatise in connexion with the
various matters 10 which such 0001011000 101010.
