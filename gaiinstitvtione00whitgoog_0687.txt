'l'he Libellsry procedure which existed in the time of J ustinisn,
having superseded the Formulny procedure, was essentislly the
same as cognitio extraordinaria. Instead of the summoue before
the praetor (in jus vocatio) end notice cf the action which the
plsintiff meant to bring (editio actionis) with which the Formulnry
procedure commenced, Libellary procedure began with libellus con·
ventionis (at en earlier time with what is called litis denuntiatio,
instituted by Marcus Aurelius) end writ of summons. The libellus
conventionis wus swriting sddoessed to the court, signed hythe
plaintiff, stating his cause of action, and binding himself to proceed
to Litis Gentestctio within two months ct latest, or pay twice the
costs up to thirty-six aurei, to prosecute the suit to judgment ond
puy the costs in the event of losing the cause: it was a form cf suing
out e writ or summoue. Thereupon followed en interlocutcr ci the
court, on its finding evelid cause of action disclosed in the libellus,
und this formul document something like cn English writ wse
addressed to the defendunt end served on 111111, not by the plaintiff
but by an officer of the court (executor) slong with the libellus. The
defendunt then puid s fee (sportula) to executor proportioned to the
amount oi the claim3 delivered his snswer or counterdeclnrstion
(libellus contradictionis, responsionis) signed by himself end scknow·
ledging the date of the receptior of the libellus; snd either gave
cautio judicio sisti, security for his cppeemnoe in the action for the
definitive appointment of the trial (judicio ordinando) 111111101- his
continusnce to the close of the trial (cautio de rs defendenda), cr was
liable to incarceration. As we heve already seen, the action wne no
longer tried by o judex privatus but by sn imperial official. cf.

Gaius hes given us no informetion concerning Appecl, end very
little informetion hes come down to us from other sources as to the
origin end development oi this kind of jurisdiction under the
Principste. (See on this subject Historicel Introduction.) Under
the republic we henr of no right of Appesl in civil suits: it appears
however with the principale, and indeed with the first princeps: und
moy here been derived from the tribunicia potestus. The jurisdic-
tion msy hove been only exercised ut first in respect oi ceses belonging
to the cognitio extraordinarie oi the magistrate, und so not for some
time hove been spplicsble to the decisions of private judices. By
its extensior to these the judex lost the independent position which
he held inthetime of the republic und was brought under the control
of the supreme executive power. The following series of Appeels in
civil suits seems to heve been institutedr From the Judex to the
