The division οι actions into stricti juris and bonae fidei, properly
speaking, only embraces actions founded οιι contract and quasi·
contract with a formula in jus concepta: thetis to say, Real actions
actions with a formula in factum concepta, actions on delict, praetoria
cognitio (cogniaance hythe praetor without reference ιο a judex)
were neither stricti juris nor· ex bonafide. It is probable, however.

This principle, weakened by the growth οι extraordinaria cognitio,
was abandoned under Diocletian and his successore, when, as we
