181118 8888118; (O) 18118 1111888888. 118188 consider it in each 81
these applicatione.

(A) Testamenti 188118 activa sometimes comprehende all the con·
ditions (physical included) 81 testamentary capacity, and then it
excludes children below the 838 81 puberty aud lunatica: but the
proper meaning cf testamenti factio is the qualification by Status 181
mancipatio, and consequently 181· 118 mancipatory will: that 18 18
say, it is equivalent 18 commercium, and therefore 18 ascribed to
811 cives, all Latini, and all aliens who have received a grant 81
commercium.

'l'o make 8 will, however, 8 18818181 must have not only personal
capacity, buthe must 8188 have property 18 leave. This latter
condition 18 necessarily wanting to the Filiusfamilias and 18 118
Latinus Junianus: in their case, therefore, Testamenti 188118 does
181 18888 capacity 81 1818318818181,18181 playing some other
part in the mancipatory will ; i. 8. 81 being heir, 81 1838188, 81 witness.

'l'he testator’s capacity is required at two periods: at the time 81
making the will and at 1118 11818 81 118 testator's death. The 811181
civil law 8188 required the continuance 81 capacity during the in·
lerval between these dates: but the praetor disregerded any inter-
vening incapacity (capitis diminutio minima), and, notwithstanding
such an event, gave the will efficacy by granting 18 118 heir, not

’ 118 civil hereditas (which was beyond his power), but juxta-tabular

possession (bonorum possessio juxta 81 secundum tabulas), §§ 145-147,
comm, Ulpian 23, 6. Dig. 37, 11, l, 8 Exigit praetor 81 18 cujus
honorum possessio datur utroque tempore jus testamenti faciendi
habuerit, et quum facit testamentum etcum moritur. . . . Sed si
quis utroque 18188818 testamenti factionem babuerit, medio tempore
non habuerit, bonorum possessio secundum 1818188 peti poterit.

Two other cases 81 incapacity were cured by the principle 81
postliminy and the lex Cornelia testamentaria: 11 8 18818181 suffered
capitis diminutio maxima by falling into the hands 81 the enemy,
when he returned from captivity his will reacquired validity by the
operation 81 postliminy: 11 18 88181 returned his will obtained
validity by the fiction that he died 8 81818881 before his capture.
Dig. 28, 3, 6, 12 Quatenus 188188 diximus ab hostibus capti testa-
mentum irritum fieri, adjiciendum est postliminio reversi vires 8888
18818818 jure postliminii, aut si ibi decedat, lege Cornelia confirmari.
Dig. 49, 15, 18 18 81881188 partibus juris, is, qui reversus non
cst ab hostibus, quasi tunc decessisse videbar, 8818 888188 est.
Ulpian, 23, 5.

The physical conditione 81 testamentary incapacity (infancy, lunacy)
are only critical at the date of making the will.
