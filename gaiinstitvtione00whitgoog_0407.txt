It is to be remembered too that the want 01 contractual agency
was to 0 great extent supplied by the rule that contractual rights
acquired by slaves or filiifamilias were acquired 101 their superior.
We have already mentioned, § 100, that in Justinian's legislation
a contractor could contract for a payment to or bya third person,
when that person was his own heir.

§§ 105, 106. For the same reasonsasthcse givenin the 10111, neither
deaf nor dumb persons could make, 01 be witnesses to, a manci·
patory will. Persons thus physically incapabls, as wellas lunatice,
might be represented for some purposes by curatore. The contract
01 0 lunatio, it is to 110 noticed, is not 1011101110, as in English law,
but void, ‘quia non intellegit quid agat'

§ 109. The age 01 puberty, 00 we 11010 00011, came to be lixed at
14 101 1110100, 12 101 semeles. Before this period the child was
called impubes: but 1110 capacity 01 the impubes varied with his
age. Up to the age 0171101100 infans; in the interval between 7
01111 14 he was described either 00 infantiae proximus or as pubertati
proximus. According to some commentatore the interval was equally
divided 1101110011 these appellatione, so that from 7 to 1010 boy
was infantiae proximus, and 110111 10110 14 pubertati proximus.
According to Savigny these names only covered the space oi a year
measured from each 1111111,οο that 110111 7 10 8 0 child was infanti
proximus, from 1310 14 puberi proximus, and 1101118 to 13 without
any distinctiva appellation. Ol. l, 142, 00111111.
