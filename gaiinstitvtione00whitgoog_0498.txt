438 ADDENDUM

contemplation oi acontract animated bysuch acause thatwe abstained
when beginning thie note, from saying unreservedly that 1111 actual
agreements were 11 respect 011111 motives giving rise 10 them bilateral.

Iwill seiae the present opportunity 01 supplying an omission in
the commentary and noticing another 11111111 common to many
Formal dispositione.

The 10111111 dispositione 01 Roman jurisprudence were frequently
1111111111. When a new juristic purpose was to be accomplisbed,
the method 01 jurisprudence was, instead 01 creating 101 11 by an
effort of imagination a new corporeal form, 10 lay hold 01 some exist·
ing disposition, and wrenching it 11011 01 less completely 11011111
original basis and original 1111110 employits more or less twisted
and (1111011111 form as a vehicla or incorporation 01 the new intention.
The new intention is the reality: the original intentionis divorced
11011 the form once its own, and nowis merely 1111111111. Thus
the festuca wielded in Sacramentum perhaps represents the weapcn
intended 10 bs used in a duel, the older mode 01 ascertaining rights
Surrender before the magistrate (in jure cessio) 11 intended to effect
a transfer 01 ownership 11011 person to person: in form it is a judg·
ment respectiug an already existing ownership. Transcriptioia
nomina were intended 10 operate novatione, to 1111110111 equitable
into legal obligation: inform they were loans of money. Mancips·
tion, 11011111 form 01 convsying dominion, 1111111111111 11111111 the
accompaniment 01 primeval sales, the weighing 011111 uncoined massas
01 bronze that served as purchase money. The form then, instead
01 being the natural execution and expression 01 11 intention, has
but a remote correspondence 10 the end which it embadies, and η
sometimes may be called 1111101101 1. g. the productiori 01 the scales
and bars of bronna and pantomimo 01 weighing in Mancipation was
the natural mode 01 executing an archaic sale, but ismerely a 1111110111
01 hieroglyphic expression 01 the transfer 01 ownership. Sometimes
a mimetic disposition became itself the object 01 subsequeut mimicry,
1111111111 the mode 01 discharging obligations, called acceptilatio
Aquiliana.

The simulative character was not a universal feature even 01 the
older Formal dispositione: 101 instance, Stipulation seems 10 have
had nothing mimetic in its form: while later jurisprudence, when it
had to invent a form, never adopted the symbolio style. Rigorous
101111 were prescribed ae a condition of 1111 validity 01 varicus dis
positione: e. g. the presence 01 1 certain number 01 1111111111 1011110
execution 01 1 will: memorandum in the judicial reconde (actis,
gestis insinuare) for donatione 01 more than 500 solidi 01101 effecting
emancipation by entry 11 such records (emancipatio Justinianeal:
none 01 which were simulatione 01 any 11011 primitive procedure.
