view of 'this type of redress that the Roman lawyers were led to speak
01 110 objeots 01 primary and reparativo secondary rights as identical

Il we next proceed 10 inquire what classes 01 actions are brought
100 0000001100 00 10 recover the object 010 primary right (rei perae·
cutio), 001 what 100 110 recovery ofa penalty (000000 persecutio}
§§ 6-9, we shall have 00 difficulty in perceiving that real actions and
actions on contract belong to the former class (rei persecutio) ; 001
110101 actions 00 delict, some ere reparatory, as e. g. condictio
furtiva while others havefor 11010 object a penalty (poenae persecutiot,
such as the 00110 furti, while in some again both objects are combined
o. g. 00110 vi bonorum raptorum. Inst. 4, 6, 16-19. The effect 01
real 0011000 001 010011000 on contract 10 restoration: they leave 110
01010111 00 richer and the defendant no poorer in respect 01 pro·
party than 10 was at first; whereas the purely pensl 0011000 leave the Ἴ
01010111, 10 respect oi property, richer, and the defendant pomer.
But the remaining divisione 01 actions 00 delict, those brought 10
recover indemnification 100 damage to property, 000 more ambiguous ,
10 character. If we merely regard their effect on the plaintiff they
seem 10 10 purely reparativo, 100 they leave the plaintiff no richer:
but 11 we regard their effect on 110 defendant they seem to he
penal, for 11 110 wrong done hythe defendant was 0 destruction 01
property, compensation to the plaintiff will leave the defendant
poorer. These actions 00 101101, which may be called vindictive
(quae ad ultionem pertinent, quae vindictam continent), as having
100 11010 special object the 0011010011οο 01 110 injured feelings 01110
plaintiii, such 00 110 actio injuriarum, have 110 effect of penalising
the defendant, and so rather resemble the purely penal actions ex
delicto than such 00 are merely reparatory.

We have seen, 3 §ala comm, that, even under a contract‚ damages
could include indirect 100000 00 110 mediate value 01110 primary
right, and might, according 10 110 limitation made by J ustinian,
cod. 7, 47, l, amount to twice the immediate value 01110 subject·
matter 01 110 obligation, where this 000 10 ascertained: and that
10 the case 01 actions, founded on delict, damages, 00 distinct frum
penalty, were 001 restricted to any maximum.

But delictul actions, whether they are regarded as rei persecutio,
or 00 poenae persecutio, or as mixtae, are generally subject 10 110
following rules: they are not pessivsly transmissible, ie. they 000
001 maintainable against the heir 01 110 101001001, except so 100 as
the inheritance he has sucoeeded to was enriohed by the delict, unless
there hes been joinder of issue (lis contestata) against the wrongdoer,
10 which cese the 10110101 obligation is novated, 3 § 180, 001 becomes
passively transmissible; moreover, they are maintainable against each
one 01 several delinquente 100110 001100 damages (in solidum); and
