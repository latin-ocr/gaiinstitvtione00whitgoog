extension, according to Gaius, § 24, violated the rules of statute·
process, which ought to rest in its minutest details on the express
provisions of a statute.

The lex Marcia is an early law of uncertain date, cf. Livy, 7, 21.
Ite poena, like that ol lex Furia testamentaria, was quadruplum: (lato
de Re Rustica quoted by Gellius.

The general opinion now is that execution against an insolvent
debtorin the old Roman law was always directed immediately against
the person of the debtor; it is certain that execution against his
entire property, under the name of Bonorum venditio, 3 ξ 77, was
a later invention of the Praetor. Savigny, however, supposes that
under the law of the Twelve Tables itself execution against the
person was confined with certain exceptione to judgments on an
actual loen of money, and that execution on other judgments was
always against the estate: and by thie view, he seeks to throw light
on an obscure problem, the nature of the ancient contract of Nexum.
¹ A case, other than a judgment debt, in which the creditor might
proceed by Manus injectio seems to be, besides those mentioned in
the text, Furtum manifestum, 3 § 189.

With liability to Manus injectio for a quasi judgment debt we
may compare the arrest of an absconding debtor in the English law
by a wn't of capias ad respondendum. As the Roman debtor had to
find a vindex or responsible representative, so the English debtor
must either remain in custody or put in bail, that is, find aureties
who will undertake that, if judgment is obtained against him, either
he shall surrender into custody, or shall pay the debt and coste
recovered, or that they themselves will pay them for him. 'Phe
Roman Vindex apparently became responsible for twice the amount
of the original debt.

5 25. Bethmann·Hollweg, 2 ξ 111, conjectures that under the
formulary procedure actio judicati, when the judicium was legitimum
(ξ 103), was fictitious, and had a formula like the following: Quod

Numerius Negidius Aulo Agerio sestertium decem milia condemna·
tus est, Si Aulus Agerius Numerio Negidio manus injecisset: tum
quidquid Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio dare facere oporteret:
ejus, judex, Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio duplum condemna.
If the judicium was imperio continens, he supposes that the aetio
judicati was in factum with the following formula: Si paret Nume-
rium Negidium Aulo Agerio sestertium decem milia condemnatum
esse eamque pecuniam intra legitimum tempus solutam non esse:
quanti ea res erit, tantae pecuniae duplum judex Numerium Negi-
dium Aulo Agerio condemna (But see in respect of these highly
