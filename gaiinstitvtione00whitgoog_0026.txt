κέ HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION

head were called Agneti; but these Agnati had not the rights of
inheritance‚ or perhaps the other family rights, possessed by the
Gentiles. 'Phe rights of plebeian Agnati were recognized by the
'Twelve Tables ; but this was perhaps the first recognition that they
gained. In the second place, of the two rights which were sub·
sequently considered aa forming the minimum conditione of citizen·
ship, the J us Conubii was, we know, not possessed at all by Plebeians,
and it is probable that they possessed the Jus commercii in a very
imperfect form. We cannot it is true, point to a time when no
Plebeian could conclude a contract, or bring an action, unless, like
a client, he acted through a patron. But it is probable that in early
times he had a very limited capacity for controlling land3 that he
held the ground, which he worked for himself, merely on sufferanoe
(Precario), and not in virtue of his civic right (ex Jure Quiritium) ¹.
This seems proved by the fact that he was not originally liable to
service in the legionef: for there can be little doubt that such
service was a burden imposed on landowners³. It seems that the
one great condition which led to the riae of the Plebeiane as a
power fn the State was the recognition of their rights as independent
holders of land. This recognition was accorded because their ser-
vices were required as soldiere in the legions and as tax-payers.
They could now hold and dispose of Res Mancipi; th t is, those
kinds of property which were assessed at the Census (Res Censui
Censendot⁴ and which, as being liableto such assessment, required
peculiar methods of transfer as evidence of ownership. This change
must have preceded or accompanied the great epoch of reform which
is associated with the name of Servius Tullius.

little good to the class as a whole. Its true strength lay in its
