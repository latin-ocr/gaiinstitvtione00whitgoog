xxxii HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION

transmission to their successore (perpetua et tralaticia]; for jurie-
diction does not admit of occasional and isolated ordinances which
have only a temporary validity. The edicte of the Praetors were
necessarily of thie latter type Each new occupant of the office
might admit rulings not recognized by his predecessors; these
rulings were forced on him by the fact that new and unexpected
combinations in legal relations had been presented to his notice, or
that the existing rules did not answer to a growing sense of equity.
Now rulings cannot be introduced into a system of law without
affecting old ones. 'Phe fact that there was an edict gave the
Praetor a chance of smoothing out anomalies, instead oi exhibiting
inconsistenoiee, in the law. The edict admitted of change and
development; but it was a change that was subtle and gradued, not
violent and rapid. The process by which it was reached proiessed
to bo a process of interpretation. It was really creative work of
a highly original kind.

The Edictum of the Praetor ¹, in the sense in which this word
is commonly used, is really a colloquial expression for the Album,
or great notice-heard exhibited by the Praetor, which contained
other elements besides the Edicta in their true and proper sense.
It contained the Legis Actiones and the Formulae of the Civil Law
(J us civile) ², probably preceded by certain explanatory hesdinge, but
by no edict3 for the Praetor did not create the rulinge on which
these civil actions and formulae were based. But it contained
as well the Formulae which were the creation of him and his pre·
decessore -the Formulae which were the product of what was known
as ‘Magistrate’s Law’ (J us Honorarium); and each oi these Formulae
was no doubt preceded, at least eventually, by the Edictum or ruling
in law, which might have grown out of the Formula, but finally
served as its basis and justification. Thus the edictal part oi the
Album was really a series of separate Edicta, each edict being
followed by its Formula; it was regarded as being a supplement to
that portion which specified the Actione of Oivil Law; and it really
had thie character of being a mere supplement ineo far as ‘honorary'
actions were seldom granted where a ‘civil’ action would have
suffioed. But its supplementary character was of a very far-reaching
kind. Thus the edicte might take cognizance of cases not provided
for by the civil law at all, they might replaoe the mechaniam pro·
vided by the civil law for attaining a legal end, and they might alter
the character of the end itself. All these functione are summed up
by Papinian when he says thot the work oi the J us Praetorium was
‘to assist, to supplement, to correct the civil law sor the sake of
