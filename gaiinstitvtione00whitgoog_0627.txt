Π. §t lle-137] DE EXCEPTIONIBVS 567

liceat voluntate colligere: hoo estut ea quae lege fieri prohibentur,
si fuerint facta non solum inutilia, sed pro infectis etiam habeantur,
licet legis lator fieri prohibuerit tantum nec specialiter dixerit inutile
csse debere quod facturn est. Sed et si quid fuerit subsecutum exeo
vel ob id, quod interdicente lege factum est, illud quoque caesum
atque inutile esse praecipimus, (lod. 1, 14, 5. So in English law
a eontract is by implicatior forbidden and void, when a statute,
without saying that the contract shall be void, inflicta a penalty
on the maker; for a penalty implies a prohibition. Pollock, Gon-
tract, p. 293, rth ed. In some cases statutos prohibited transactione
of a particular kind without however expressly deelaring them void.
In such cases the transaction was not ipso jure void, but the person
sued on it could plcad an exceptio founded on the statute. Thus
the Sc. Macedonianum and Sc Vellaeanum render the dispositione
which contravene them liable to Exceptio, which is inconsistent
with nullification.

2. Examples ot the second line of defense are in real action the
everment of a subsequent loss of ownership by dereliction or
usucapion or alienation‚ or loss of servitus by non-usus: in here·
ditatis petitio the avoidance ol a valid will by agnatio postumi or
by the execution of a later will: in personal action the extinction
ofa debt by solutio, acceptilatio (formal release), novatio.

In general, the avoidance cf a right may either bo produced by
the very disposition by which the right is originated, viz. by the
fulfilment of a resolutius condition which it contains: or by some·
thing external, e. g. by judgrnent, when res judicata operatos not as
a counteraetive but as an extinctive ples, 3 ᾗ 180: or bya contrary
disposition, e. g. dereliction of property, repudiaticn of the delatio
of legatum or hereditas. In respect of contrary dispositione the
general rule obtains that to produce complete invalidity the second
disposilion must be of similar form to the first; otherwise it only
produces incompleta invalidity (exceptio, eccunteractive plea): Nihil
tem naturale est, quam eo genere quidque dissolvere, quo collign-
tum est: ideo verborum obligatio verbis tollitur: nudi consensus
obligatio contrario consensu dissolvitur, Dig. 50, 17 35. Thus, a
stipulation is extinguished by a formal release (acceptilatio), but
only counteracted by an informal release [pactum dc non petendo).
Furtum and injuria were extinguished by nudum pactum, in spite
of the dissimilarity of disposition and tort: offence cnd reconcilia-
tion, ‘as Kuntze observes, § 6³2, being regarded as contraries
Quaedam actiones per pactum ipso jure tolluntur, ut injuriarum,
item furti, Dig. 2, 14, 17, 1. An informal release followed by an
informal revocation (pactum de petendolie not extinguished but
³ only counieraoted, ξ lltc, and Dig. 2, 14, 27, 2.
