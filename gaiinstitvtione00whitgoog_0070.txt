standing on the ground may read’ Such an edict was always
published on entering on office (est enim tibi jam, cum magistratum
inieris et in concionem adscenderis, edicendum quae ais observaturus
injure dicendo,¹ Cic. De Fin. 2, 22), and was theu called Edictum
perpetuum, as opposed to occasional proclamatione, Edictum repen·
tinum. Α clause (pars, caput, clausula, edictum) retained from a
former edict was called Edictum tralaticium, Gellius, 3, 183 and
though doubtless the edicta gradually changed according to changing
emergcncies, each suooeeding praetor with very slight modificatione
substantially reproduced the edict of his predecessor. In the reign
of Hadrian the jurist Salvius Julianus, called by Justinian Prae-
toriani edicti ordinator, reduced the edict to its definite form, and
if the yearly publication was not discontinued (cf. ξ 6, jus edicendi
habent), at all events Julian’s coordination of Praetorian law was
embodied in all subsequent publicatione. Such was the origin oi
jus honorarium (praetorium, aedilicium), as opposed to jus civile:
and from what has preceded, it need hardly be stated that the
antithesis, jus civile,- jus honorarium, is to a great extent coincident
with the antithesis, jus civile, jus gentium.

It may be observed that Gaius does not attribute to edicte the
force of a statute: and this theoretical interiority of jus hono·
rarinm had a vast influence in modelling the forms and prooeedings
of Roman jurisprudence. The remedy or redress administered to
a plaintiff who based his claim on jus civile differed from that
administered on an appeal to jus honorarium, as we shall see when
we come to treet of Bonitary ownership, Bonorum possessio, Actio
utilis, in factum, ficticia. This difference oi remedy preserved jus
civile pure and uncontaminated, or at least distinguishabls from jus
honorarium but this perpetuation oi the mamory oi the various
origins oi the law, like the anelogous distinction of Equity and
Common law in English jurisprudence, was purchased by sacrificing
simplicity of ruls and uniformity of process«

The legislative power of the popular assembly and the absence
ol legislativa power in the senate and praetor were marked by a
difference of style in the lex and plebiscita, edict, and decree of
the senate: while the lex and plebiscita employed the imperative
(damnas esto, jus potestasque esto, dec), the resolutions of the senate
scrupulously avoid the imperative and are clothed in tha forms
placere, censere, arbitrari, dra, as if they were rather recommen-
datione than commanda: and the edicta and the interdicta of the
praetor are couched in the subjunctive (Exhibeas, Restituas, dra), a
milder form of imperative. Or to show that their force and opera·
tion is limited to his own tenure of office, they are expressed in the
first person (actionem dabo, ratum habebo, vim fieri vetet Where
