184 SVOOESSIO PER VNIVERSITATEM [11. §blm-114.

whether hores or legatarius, required testamenti factio passiva, which
like testamenti factio activa meant commercium or capacity of taking
part in mancipatio. Accordingly both a filiusfamilias and a Latinus
could be heres or legatae (for the limitation, however, oi the capacity
of Latinus Junianus by the lex Junia see below). 'I'his capacity
must exist at three periods (tria temporat: the making oi the will,
the death oi the testator, and the acquisition oi the succession bytho
heres (aditio). 'Phe interval between the making of the will and
the death of the testator was immaterial, Inst. 2, 19, 4, Dig. 28, 5,
60, 4. The interval between the death oi the testator and the aditio
oi the heres was material, because on the first heres institutus be·
coming incapable the inheritance would be instantaneously deleted
(offered for acceptante) to the heres substitutus orto the heres ab
intestato.

The looking to the capacity of Honoratus attha date of making
the will as well as later, though apparently based on no motivas of
testamentary policy, but only due to the mancipatory form of the
primitive will, which was ostensibly a mancipatio inter vivos.
ie. a disposition taking effect in the lifetime of the mancipator,
was retained in Justinian’s legislation after willa had lost their
mancipatory form.

In respect of Honoratus it is necessary to distinguish institutio
from acquisitio (aditio); and testamenti factio passiva competenee
for institution, from capacitas or jus capiundi, competente ior
acquisition. Testamenti factio passiva was mquired at the date of
the making oi the will; and in its absence a disposition was deemed
tc be unwritten (pro non scripto habetur); and the property dis·
poscd oi went by Aocretio to the other heredes scripti. Gapacitas‚
in its distinctiva sense, was only required at the date of acquisition ;
and in its absence the unacquired property became caducous, and
devolved in part or in whole to persons iulfilling certain conditione
orto the state, as determined by the lawe of caducity.

Incapaoes, or persons who, from want ot capacity to take, forfeited
part or the whole of the testator’s bcunty, comprehended:

(ι) Latini Juniani, who were made incapable by the lex Junia,
1§23‚ 2 §a 110, 2⁷5. cf. Ulpian, 17, 1.

(2) 'Phe unmarried (caelibes) were totally, and the married but
childlesa (orbi) were made partially incapable by the lex Papia
Poppaea .

(3) Husband or wife (vir et uxor), who by the same law could
only take, as between one another ii they had nc children, one
tenth of a heritage, and another tenth for every living child by a
former marriage: further, another tenth for a common child that
lived to the day of naming (nominum dies), or as Mommsen (Staatsr.
