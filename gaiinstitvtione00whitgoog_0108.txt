In any treatise on the law of marriage that we open we shall
meet bbe expression, the marriage contract3 and this suggests the
inquiry, is marriage a contmct, and, if so, ιο which class of Roman
contracte, Verbal‚ Liberal, Real, consensual, 3 ξ 89, is Roman
marriageto be referred? Most writers assume ibat ir was a Ocn-
sensual contrari, on the strength of faxis like the following: Nuptias
non concubitus sed consensus facit, Dig. 35, 1,15. ‘Marriage does
not depend on cohabitation, but on consenh’ Orbelon, however,
remarks thar consensual contracta could be formed by absenb eon·
tractors, Insh 3, 22, 2, whereas a marriage could not be contracted
in the absence of the wife, Paul, 2, 19, 8; and shows that, besides
ure consent of the parties, delivery of possession of the wife ιο the
husband was required, from whioh be infers thal Roman marriage
was nol a consensual but a Real contrari Ιι is brus thal marriage
might be eontracted in the absence of the husband; bus this was
only under certain conditione, Dig. 23, 22, 5. ‘A man in his
absence may marry by letter or message, provided the woman is
led ιο bis house: a woman in her absence oannol marry by letter
or message, for the leading muel be ιο ihs husband’s house, as hbe

domicile of the married pain' And precisely the same conditions
