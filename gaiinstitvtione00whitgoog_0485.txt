the form of actio in factum concepta, though the actio ficticia in jus
concepta was sometimes used. of. 4 ξ 37.’

The statement in the corresponding passage of the Institutas (4, 3,
16) that the actio in facturn is to be distinguished from the actio
utilis legis Aquiliae is probably erroneous. There is no trace of such
a distinction in Gaius, and in the Digest the term actio in factum

is used in all cases of extensiones tha statute. Itis to be remembered
that at the time of the compilation of the Institutes the formulary pro·

cedure, to which the terms actio utilis and actio in factum refer, had . ·

long ceased to be the practice. (Grueber, Lex Aquilia, pp. 199-208.)
The mode of growth of Roman law and the ‘relation between
directa Aquilia and utilis Aquilia may be illustrated by similar
phenomena in English law, and the relation between the two forms
of action called Trespass and Trespass on the Oase, Trespass, which
lies for injury to real or personal property or to the person, accom-
panied with violence, has a more extensive application than directa
Aquilia, but viewed only as redrossing injurios to personal property,
is nearly coextensive in its range. The original scheme of actions,
devised in comparatively barbarous times, contained no remedy for
injurios where there is no act done but only a culpable omission,
or where the actis not immediately injurious, but only by conse·
quence or collaterally, or where the idea of force is inapplicable
because the subject-matter is not corporeal or tangible, although
the injury may be by act direct and immediate in its operation.
'Po supply such deficienciesthe statute of westminster, 13 Edward I,
had directed the clerks in chancery to frume new writs whenever
the old scheme of writs contained no remedy for awrong resem-
bling in its features other wrongs for which aremedy was provided.
Accordingly, anew writ of Trespass on the Osse was framed upon
the analogy of the old torm of Trespass (confer, ad exemplum
institorias, ς 162, comm), applying to cases where the injury is not
immediate, or the subject affected is not corporeal, or the agency is
not bodily force. What Edward Ι directed to be done by the clerks
in chanaam, and what was done by the introduction of the action of
lltespass on the (lese, was exaotly analogous to what the praetore did
when, in virtue of their magisteria] authority, they supplemented the
civil law by the introduction of actiones ficticiae and actiones in
factum. In respect of torts to personal property, the latter have
nearly the same sphere as Trespass on the Oeae. The innovatione of
the praetor, however, were not confined to the region of torts to
personal property, but pervaded every sphere and constituted a mass
of supplementary law (jus praetorium), having to the remaindor of
tho law (jus civile) somewhat similar relations and proportionata
those which equity has to common law in English jurisprudence.
