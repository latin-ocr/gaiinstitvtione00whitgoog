ut supradiximus, eademformula the actio Tributoria ς for, as I said
et de peculio etde in rem uerso above, the same formula lies both

what has been converted to uses.

t 71. The term Institor includes any one set over a business-
ouicumque negotio praepositus sit institor recte appellabitur-and
so a banker (mensae praepositus), bailiff (agris colendis), foreman cf
3 a trade (mercaturis), bagman (scd etiam eos institores dicendos

¹ placuit, quibus vestiarii vel lintearii dant vestem circumferendum

et distrahendam, quos vulgo circitores appellamus, Dig. 14, 3, 5), and
any similar agent, of whatever age orsex (namet plerique pueros
puellasque tabernis praeponunt, Dig. 14, 3, 8}

It seems probable that the actio exercitoria and institoria were first
granted by the praetor in the common case of the magister or institor
being a son or slave of his employer, when a third party contracting
with them would either have no remedy at all, or in respect of the
filius familias one which would often be ineffective, and that they
were afterwards extended to cases where the magister or institor were
free persons and slaves, extraneous to the family of the employer.

The liability of the shipowner (exercitor) and of the master
(dominus) on account of the contracte of the free captain (magister),
and of the free manager, overseer, factor (institor) made within
the scope of their employmcnt, was the germ or first manifesta·
tion of the institution ol contractual Agency, an institution that
did not ruach its complete development in Roman jurisprudence.
For in this system an agent could not be a mere instrument of
acquiring a contractual obligation for his employer, but was regarded
as being himself a party to any contract be concluded on account of
another. 'l'hus the liability of the exercitur or dominus existed
alongside or in addition to that of the magister or institor.

'Phe term actiones adjecticiae qualitatis is used by modern com·
mentators on Roman law to denote action by which this kind of
liability was enforced, because of the Adjectio or additional clause
which was introduced in their formula. By the civil law, as we
have noticed, the inferior could not bind the superior, ia deteriorate
his condition even with the consent of the superior, savigny, t 113.
But the Praetor besides the actio dhecta (empti, locati, dc), which
lay against the inferior, granted similar actions with a modified
formula (actio empti de peculio, dc.) against the superior. They are
six in number: Quod jussu, Exercitoria, Institoria, De peculio, De in
rem verso, 'I'ributoria In the formula for De peculio, and Ι)ο in
rem verso (one formula with adouble condemnatio), the adjectio was
annexed to the condemnatio with a taxatio clause limiting the
damages either to the peculium or to the amount of benefit which
the defendant had derived from the transaction in question. Keller.
