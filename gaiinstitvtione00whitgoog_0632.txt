defences by positive averment of counterpoising rights—(nec omnino
ita, ut nunc, usus erat illis temporibus exceptionum, § 108); but
required every defence 10 he in the form of a simple 111001100-
allegation of the original or subsequent nnnnmr of the plaintiffs
claim. Unlike proceedings by Formula, which besides the ipsum
jus of the plaintiff, investigated the ceaster-claime (Exceptio) of the
defendant, statute-process strictly confined itself to a direct affirma·
tion or denial of the plaintiff's right At such a period 000 01 11ιο
devices for giving to the defendant the means of defence which he
afterwards had in the form of Exceptio was the introduction into
the Substantive code of certain principles respecting the nullification
of rights which practicclly answered the purpose of the Exceptions
afterwards introduced into the Adjective code.

An example of such principles is the rule: (Necessariae) impensae
dotem ipso jure minuunt, Dig. 23, 4, 5, 2. Α husband when com·
pelled to restore the dower 10 a divorced wife was fairly entitled
to deduct what he had been obliged to spend forits conservation
during the subsistendo of matrimony. To enable the husband 10
do this the law xxrruonrsnnn the wife’s right to en equivalent
portion of the dower, and thus protected the husband as effectually
as if it had given him an Exceptio asserting an independent right
of retention. (It is to be noticed that the actio rei uxoriae for the
recovery of dos, being regarded as an actio bonae fidei, empowered
the judex to take impensae necessariae into account without any
exceptio being added to the formula, cf Sohm, p. 487.) Sc the
rulo: Legata pro rate portione per legem ipso jure minuuntur,
Dig. 35, 2, 73, 5, gave to an heir the right of retaining his Falcidium
fourth as effectually as he could have done by pleading an Exceptio
legis Falcidiae. Agein the rule: Ipso jure minutum esse peculium,
Dig. 19, 1, 30, pr., gave to an heir, when a slave and his peculium
had been boqueathed to a legates, the right of deducting whatever
the slave owed by naturalis obligatio to the testatores effectually as
if he had been allowed to plead the debt of the slave in an Exceptio,
cf § 73.

It is remarkable that a husband’s right, 544, 001010, 10 deduct
from the dower all utdcs as opposed to messoriae impensae was
protectcd by an Exceptio, Dig. 25, 7, 1. As there seems 10 be 00
valid reason for a different treatment of utiles impensae end neces·
seriae impensae, the explanation why the deduction of neaemanae
was effectuated by Extinction and that of utiles by Exception can
only be found in the hypothesis that the former right was recognized
by the law before, the 111101 attor, Exceptions hed been introduced
into the Adjcctive code. lhoring, ξ 52.
