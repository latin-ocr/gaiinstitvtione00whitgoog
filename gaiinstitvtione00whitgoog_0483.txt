double oi the immediate valuc, hoc quod interest dupli quantitatem
minime excedere, cod. 7, 47 ; but left claime founded on delict with·
out any similar limitation. In claims founded on breach oi contract
we may distinguish two obligations: the primary obligationes defined
by the promise oi the contractor, the secondary or sanctioning obli·
gation produced bytho non-fulfilment of the promise. According to
the nature of the contract, this non-fulfilment will be either the non·
performance oi some service; or the non-delivery of some goede,
morable or immovable; or non-delivery at the covenanted time or
covenanted place ; or negligent custody and consequent deterioration
or destruction of some article deposited by the plaintiff; or eviction
of the plaintiff from some property transferred to him by the defen·
dant; or any other omission or non-ieasance. The secondary
obligation ofa defendant may be divided into two portione, one
corresponding to the immediate value to the plaintiff of the fulfil-
ment of the primary obligatiou the other conesponding to his
mediate or indirect losses occasioned hy its non-fullilment. The
first portion may be regarded aa principal, the second as accessory.
Similarly the active obligation or claim oi the plaintiff may be divided
into two parts, principal and accessory. By the enactment oi Justi·
nian, in an action founded on contract, the accessory claim can never
exoeed the principal, or, in other words, the total claim of the
plaintiff can never exceed in amount twice the velue of his principa]
claim. In obligations arising from delict there is no primary obliga·
tion or principal claim capable of furnishing a corresponding unit of
measurement. 'Phe primary obligation of the defendant is here
a necessity of abstention which is not called by the Romans obli·
gati0: and the primary right of the plaintiff is a real right, a right
against all the world to freedom from molestation; which real right
’ is not so definite or capable of exactvaluation or appreciation as a
personal claim. Accordingly the sanctioning right of the plaintiff in
this case is leit by J ustinian without limitation or maximum3 and
the judex ie directed to assess the amount of whatever damage the
plaintiii has actually incurred.

The enactment of Justinian was probably suggested by the stipu-
latio duplae annexed to contracte of sale, whereby in *case oi evictiou
the purchaser was eutitled to recover from the vendor twice the
purchasemouey. Vangerow, 5 571.
