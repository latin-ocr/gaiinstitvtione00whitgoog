THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF JUS xvii

and to criminal jurisdiction. Administrative jurisdiction has as its
object either the enforcement of a personal service to the State cn
an individual, or the exaction of a debt which he owes to the State.
'l'he obligation to service is generally enforced by a fine irnposed by
the magistrate. But whether what is demanded hythe State takes
the form of personal service or a pecuniary debt, the characteristic of
administrativa jurisdiction at an early period of Roman History is
that the magistrate who represents the State has a double character.
He is not only prosecutor or plaintiff but also judge. This principle,
however, was eventually modified. If the fine imposed exceeded
a certain limit, an appeal to the People was allowed¹3 and, later ¹
still, the penalty might be sought either by a magistrate cr a
common informer before a civil court ¹. When a debt to the State
was the object of disputa, the custom may eventnally have been
established that the magistrate should not himself judge, but should
appoint for this purpose a panel of those assessore of debts or
damages who were known as Recuperatores’.

The question as to what particular cases shall fall under each of
these three heads of Civil, Criminal and Administrative Law is one
that is answered differently by different political societies; and Rome
herself gave different replies to this question at various periods of
her history. But we know of no period in the life of Rome when
the distinction between these three types of Iaw and Procedure was
not clearly grasped, and expresssd by the higher judicial authorities,
who were at Rome in every real sense the malrers of law.

The problem of the ultimate source and sanction of J us was not
one that troubled the Roman to any appreciable degree at any period
of history. He was content to regard it as the product of Oustom
assistsd by Interpretation. At a later period he supplemented it by
acts of legislation; but, even when he did so, he was much less
concerned with the words of the enactmsnt than with the manner
in which these words were interpreted. Scarcely any people has
had less of a gift, or natural inclination for, scientific legislation or
the formation of a Gode. The Boman’s dependence on authority and
skilled interpretation was, therefore, great; and this authority and
power of interpretation are believed to have been represented, in the
