· THE TWELVE TABLES xxiii

giren to testamentary disposition as performed ‘per aes et libram '¹3
while, in the matters of intestato inheritance and guardianship, the
rights 01 the Agnati‚ common to Plebeians and Patricians, were
regarded as prior to those of the Gentiles ¹. The harsh law 01 deht,
which was a resultat once 01 freedom 01 contract and 01 the very
severe view which ancient societies take of the defaulting debtor‚
was maintained; the Judicatus still became the bondsman 01 1010
creditor ⁸, but now [perhaps ior the first time), all the stages 01 the
process of execution were published to the world, the rights of the
creditor were defined, the chauces of escape open to the debtor were
accurately described. Loans on interest were permitted; but the
maximum rate 01 interest was fixed at ‘unciarium foenus '⁴ (probably
ten per cent.); and the usurer who exceeded this rate was punished
more severely than the ordinary thief3 hewse compelled to restore

tsiouriold ⁵. With respect 1ο 01011 Procedure (the exclusive knowledge
ef which had been one of the greatest elementa 01 strength in the
patrician government) it is clear that the outlines oi the process-
such as tho rules 100 the summons oi parties and witnesses, and 100
the length of the trial ο-00000 described. But it is very questionable
whether the Tables went so far as to speciiy the Forma 01 Αο1100;
the actual words and gestures, that 10, which had to bc employed
in any given csse We find a tradition that these forms were not
revealed until nearly 150 years later, and that they were first given
to the world in 301 0. e. by a certain Gnaeus Flavius²‚ 0 freedman's
son and the clerlr of Appius Claudius, the censor 01 312 aa, who
was apparently also pontiti. But the traditione connected with the
publication at Rome, 0000 01 the simplest information about Pro·
cedure, are erceedingly obscure. On the one hand, we hear that
this same Gnaeus Flavius published a Calendar which gave a record
01 court Days (Dies Fastit⁸3 on the other hand, it was believed that
a Calendar 01 some kind had been already published by the
Decemvirs’. It is possible that the decemviral Galendcr had
beccum antiquated‚ or that it had not been restored or republished
aiter the buming of Rome by the Gauls (390 s. 0.) ¹⁰; but it is 01000
that the Romane 01 Cicero’s time had much vaguer ideas about the
epoch 01 which the forms 01 Procedurs were made accessible to the
public, than they had about the date 01 which the principles 01
substantive Law were given 1ο the world.
