THE LIFE AND WORKS OF Galus liii

than Justinian or the sixth century after Christ3 but probably did
not precede that monarch by a long interval.’

‘In a year after Niebuhr’s discovery the whole text 11 Gaius had
been copied out by Gceschen and Hollvveg, who had been sent to
Verona 111 that purpose by the Prussian Royal Academy of Seiences,
and in 1820 the first edition was published. In 1874 Studemund
published an apograph or 1111111111 volume, the fruita of a nevv
examination 11 the Veronese Ms.; and in 1877 Studemund, with
the amistanoe 11 Krueger, published a revised text of Gaius founded
on the apograph.'

‘In the text 11 Gaius, the words 11 portione 11 words which 111
purely conjectural are denoted by italica. The orthography 11 the
Veronese Ma. is extremely inconstant Some of these inconstanciee
it vvill be seen 111 retained: c. g. the spelling oacillates between 7111
forms praegnas and praegnans, nanctus and nactus, erciscere and
herciscere, prendere and prehendere, diminuere and deminuere,
parentum and parentium, vulgo end volgo, apud and aput, sed and
set, proxumus and proximus, affectus and adfectus, inponere and
imponere dec. Some irregularities likely to embarrass the render, 1. g.
the substitution of v for b in debitor end probare, the substitution
11 b for v in servus and vitium, have been tecitly corrected. The
numeration 11 the paragraphs vves introduced by Goeschan in his
first edition 11 Gaius, and for convenience cf reference has been
retained by all subsequent editors. The rubrica or titles marking
the larger divisione 11 the subject, with the exception of a few at
the beginning, are not found in the Veroncse MS. These that 111
found are supposed netto be the work of (111111, but 111 transcriber.
The remainder are partly taken from 7111 corresponding sections 11
J ustinian’s Institutas, partly invented 11 adopted 111111 171111 editors!

121. The Life 1111 Worba of 01111.

01 the life 11 Gaius we know little. Even his full name has been
lost; for, 11 ‘Gaius 'is the familiar 11111111 praenomen ¹, he must have
had a family or gentile name as well. It is probable 71117 he vves 1
foreigner by birth-a Greek or 1 Hellenised Asiatic; but it is also
probable 71117 he was 1 Romam citizen, and possible that he taught 17
Rome. It is 1117 likely that he belonged 71 the class 11 patented
jurisconsults; 111 his opinions are not quoted by 7111 subsequent
jurists whose fragments are preserved in the Digest 3 it has even been

should hm expected him to bear 1 Roman, or Romanised, name.
