ownership, acquired in away not known to the jus civile, but
introduced by the praetor, and protected by his imperium or
executive power. We have seen, for instance, that only non-man·
cipable things were capable of transfer by tradition; suppose, now,
that a mancipable thing were tonveyed by the owner to a vendee
by tradition; the process would not make him quiritary owner;
he would be no better thtsn a bonafide possessor, until by the
lapse of a yesi or of two years he acquired quiritary ownership by
usucapion. The praetor, however, assisted the less cumbrous mode
oi alienation by treatin'g the vehdee as ii he were cunin by giving
him, ii in possession, the exceptio rei venditae et traditae or ples
oi sale and delivcry against the vendor who sought to recover as
quiritary owner, and enabling th'e vendes, iidispossessed, to recover
against the qhiritary owner as well as against any third person by
utilis vindicatio, called actio Publiciana, in· w'hich he would meet the
ples of quiritary ownership (exceptio dominii) by the replicatio rei
venditae et traditae or by the replicatio doli, a replication which could
not be used by a mere bonafide possessori Bonitary ownership, or
ownership established by the praetor, when once invented, was
employed hythe praetor in other innovatione, which he introduced,
namely, aa we shall see hereaiter, in respect of res corporalis of an
insolvent debtor transferred to a purchaser by universal succession
(bonorum venditio), and in respect of his testamentary and intestate
succession (bonorum possessio): 3 § 80.

'Phe barbarous term Bonitary (formed from che classica] in bonis
esse, in bonis habere) has the 'authority of Theophilus, who speaks
oi δεσπότης βυκτάριος, l, 5, 4 ; he also cafls bonitary ownership natural
dominion (φυσικὴ δεσποτεία), as opposed to statutory, civil, or quiri·
luy dominlon (ἔννομος δεσποτεία).

Actio Publiciana was not only the remedy of th'e bonitary owner,
but was also applicable' on the alienation of anything whatever by
a non-proprietor to an innocent aliehee (bona fide possessor) in case
the latter lost possession oi it.

Usucapion, as in the case of bonitary ownsrship, might in the lapse
of time have given the hona fide possessor plenary dominion, and, with
it, vindication in the event of a loss b'f possession ; but if ha lost pos·
session whilst usucapion was still incompleta, he would have had no
real action (for, not being owner, he could not vindicate), if the
praetor had not allowed him to sue by the actio Publiciana, which
treated bona fide posscaeion, that is, usucapion possession, or the
inceptiones usucapion, ss if it were plenary dominion in respect oi
every one, except the rightful owner. The latter, however, could
defend himself in this action successfully against a mere bonafide
possessor by the exceptio dominii, or bring a vindication against a
