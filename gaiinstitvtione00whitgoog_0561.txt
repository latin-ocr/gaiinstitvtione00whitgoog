quantitas (corn, wine, 011, dc) founded a condictio triticaria. 'Phe
difference of the formulae in these actions explains the following
rule of substantive law, which otherwise seems capricious: A valid ,
informal conventior (nudum pactum) for interest could be annexed
to a loan ol corn, wine, or cil, Ood. 4, 32, 23, but not to a loan of
money, Dig. 19, 6, 24.

The reason was thia: the lom of any other quantitas than money,
havingan incerta condemnatio, allowed the judge of a suit brought

for recovery oi the principal 10 include interest in the sum which ’

he condemned 1110 defendant to pay: whereas the money loan
having a certa condemnatio, coinciding with the 1111011110 in the aum
it defined, the judge oia suit brought ior the principal, under pain
of litem suam facere, 1 52, could only condemn the defendant to pay
the principal.

Ii, then, intereat on a loan of money was intended 10 be paid, 11
was necessary 10 secure it by a formal contr-act (stipulatio) which
would found an actio ax stipulatu distinct from the condictio certi
which might be brought for the principal: whereas interest for any
other quantitas could be aecured by a pactum nudum annexed 10
the agreement 1ο return' number, weight, or measure cf the principal,
and recovered in the action brought for the principal.

As the stringeney of the rule respecting money loans depended 011
the peculiarity of the formula, it should not have been retained by
J 1101111100 1111011110 abolition of the Formulary procedure. Savigny,
Syatem, ξ 268.

The wording of the formula in Oondictio certae pecuniae was
doubtless the reason why in 1110 Formulary period 1110 legatee could
not recover interest on his legacy, 2 5 280.

Thus if he gave a wrong judgment from dolus, he was liable 10 be
condemned in the whole amount under litigaticn, Dig. ὅ, 1, 15,1. li
from culpa, he was liable to be condemned in such damages as thejudge
in hia discretion should osseas, Dig. 50, 13, 6. This is one ofthe obliga
tione classified in the institutes of J ustinian and also by Gaius in the
passage of the Digest last cited, which is an excerpt from his writings,
under the head of obligationes quasi ex delicto or quasi ex maleficio.
