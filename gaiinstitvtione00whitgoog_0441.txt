111. §t 155-162.] DE MANDATO 381

In the contract of mandate (mandatum) the principal is called '
dominus or mandator, the agent procurator or mandatary.

We have already mentioned, when treating of the verbal contract
of stipulation, that a guaranty was often given by the consensual
contractet mandata, §§ 110-127, comm. Such a mandate is called
by commentatore ununsruu oufflrrcarmr, or Mandatum (tradendi.
We have the principle explained in ξ 156: he who recommends
a third person as of good credit is bound to make good his repre·
sentation and to indemnify another who suetains damage from giving
credit on the saith of that representation. So by English law a
person not interested in a transaction who makes a false and
fraudulent misrepresentation which induces another to trust and
’ contract with a third person is answerable for the loss occasioned by
his misrepresentation.

As such a representation was in effect a guaranty, and to allow
an action on a verba] misrepresentation would avoid the Statute of
Fraude, which requires a guaranty to be reduced te writing, Lord
Tenterden's Act, 9 George IV, chapter 14, anacted that no action
shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon any repre·
sentation or assurance concerning the character, credit, or ability
of any other person, to the intent that such other person may
obtain money or goods upon credit, unless such representation or
assurance be made in writing, signed by the party to be charged
therewIth.

Another case in which a guarantor and person guaranteed stand in
the relationes mandant and mandatary occurs where Α (the mandant),
being indebted to B (the mandatary), directe or delegates B, attha
risk of Α, to obtain a promise by stipulation from a third party, C
(a debtor ol Aa), to pay to him (the mandatary) the debt which he
(O) owes to the mandant. Tua et mandantis [gratia intervenit
mandatum]‚ . . . si mandet tibi, . . . ut ipsius periculo stipularis ab
eo quem tibi deleget in id quod tibi debuerat, Inst 3, 26, 2. 'l'his is
ons example of what is known as ‘delegation,' a general term
embracing a variety of acts in all of which there is a direction or
order, to a person to do some act by which the parties to a legal
transaction are changed. Thus in every delegation there areat least
three parties, the Delegans or person delegating some one else to
another, the Delegatus, or person thus delegated, and the Dele-
gatarius, or person in whose favour the delegation is made, and the
intention of the parties is that the act to be performed by Delegatus
iu favour of Delegatarius shall have the same effect as if it had been
performed in favour of Delegans

The Delegatus may be directed to bind himself to the third party
(promittere) instead of to the Delegans, as in the above instance, or
