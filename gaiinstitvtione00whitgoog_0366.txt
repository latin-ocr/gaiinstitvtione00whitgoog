to elapse between the first seizure and the decree authorizing the
election of a magister was derived from the thirty days' interval
allowed the judgment debtor before manus injectio.

The process was begun by missio in possessionem, whereby the
praetor gave persons, who had a claim to property, provisional pos·
session of it.

Some cf the details of the proceedings in a missio in possessionem
which are omitted by Gaius may be supplied from Theophilus.
Before the final transfer of the debtor's estate hythe creditore
under the order of the magistrate (addictio) three deorees of the
praetor were necessary :-

(ι) Α decree authorizing the seizure of the debtor’s estate and its
advertisement for sale (proscriptio). Theophilus gives the form of
this advertisement: d δεῖνα χρεώστης ἡμέτερος ὑπάρχων, εἶα αἰτίαν ἐνέπεσε
διαπρόσεως. ἡμεῖς, κρεδίτωρες ὄντες, τὴν τούτου διαπιπράσκαμεν περιουσίαν.
dvorte ὁ βουλόμενος προσίτω, 3, 12. ‘So-endec, our debtor, is bankrupt;
we, his creditore, are about to sell his estate3 whoever wishes to
purchase is invited to attend! This advertisement was affixed to the
Columna Maenia, which was in the forum on the Puteal near the
Cercar. Pliny, N. H. 7, 60. In the old system of manus injectio,
the judgment debtor (judicatus), after the expiration of the thirty
dies justi, was nc longer allowed to defend an action in person, but
might, aa we see by the above-quoted fragment of the Twelve Tables,
be defended by a vindex. In the formulary system, the equivalent
of the vindex was satisdatio judicatum solvi, security with two
aureties for the payment of the judgment to be recovered, and the
judgment recoverable in an actio judicati was for twice the amount
of the disputed judgment debt, 4 §t 9, 102. Supposing, however,
the missio in possessionem was not founded on a previous judgment,
but on the debtor's absconding or heeping house, then the period at
which he was disabled from defending an action, unless he gave
security (judicatum solvi), was the expiration cf thirty days after
his estate had been seized and advertised fcr sale, Cicero, Pro Flacco.
Before the thirty days have expired‚ the debtor ie admitted to
defensio without satisdatio judicatum solvi.

(α) After the possession and proscription of the estate the banh-
rupt is infamis, and cannot defend without satisdatio judicatum
solvi; and a second decree cf the praetor empowered the creditore
to hold a meeting and elect a magister tc manage the sale, corre-
sponding in this respect to the oreditor’s assignes, or, at the present
day, the oreditcr's trustee of English law.

(3) After a certain period (ton or five days), a third deorse
authorized the publication of the conditione of sale, which were
appended to the original advertisement.
