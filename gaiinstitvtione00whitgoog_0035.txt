THE CONCHdUM PLEBIS xxix

capacity it was gathcred under the presidency of the Pontifex

Maximus for the inauguration of the Rex Sacrorum and the
flamines, and for the Detestatio Sacrorum-the renunciation of pre· ¹
existing religione obligations which was made by aman who passed
from his Gens, either by an act of Adrogatio or by transition from
the patrician to the plebeian order¹.

The assembly of the Plebs² excludcd the patriciau members of the
commnnity, and continued to be organized by tribes. Its true

resignation was Concilium Plebis, Concilium differing from Comitia

as a guther-ing of a part cf the people differs from a gathering of the
whole ³. 'Phis assembly is often spoken of by ancient writers as the
Comitia 'I'ributa; but it differed from the Comitia Tributa Populi iu
two respectu. It did not include Patricians‚ and it was presided over,
not by a magistrate of the People, but by a magistrate of the Plebs.
When it met for legislative purposes, it was presided over only by
the Tribune of the Plebs. The legislative authority of the Concilium
Plebis had developed steadily during the first two centurias of the
Republic. At first this assembly could only pass ordinances binding
on the members of the Plebs themselves. Then, by the Valerio·
Horatian and Publilian laws (449 and 339 rac.) it gained the right of
considering and initiating proposals which affected the interests of
the whole community; this right being probably acquired and
exercised by the creation of increasing facilities for bringing
resolutione of the Plebs as petitione to the assemblies of the people‚
to be confirmed or rejected by the latter ⁴. Since the Plebs came
gradually to constitute the majority of votens in the assemblies oi
the people‚ these petitione must as time went ou have been almost
invariably confirmed. 'l'he distinction between Plebiscits and Leges
must have been growing more and more formal and unreal when
the Lex Hortensia [287 a clenacted thathenceforth Plebiscita should
hare the force of Leges ⁸. From this time onwards there was no
difference between the Populus and the Plebs in matters of legislation,
except that it may have been held by some thinkers that fundamental
changes in the Constitution, such as those introduced by Sulla, ought

aeut as petitione to the consultanti senate (cf. Dionys. a. 31), suggests that the
Valerio Horatian law may have ‘laid down that the consul must so consult the
naute, or it may evan have forbidden him arbitrarily to disregard a recom-
mendation of the senate (should such be obtained) that he should put the
question to the populus’; aad that the Publilian law ‘may have struck out tho
intenening consultation of tha senate, and may have required the consul to
