11111 110-127] ABSTIPVLATIO—ADPROMISSIO 357

Β. 0011101011νο 1010100001011, 011110 addition of an obligation to
an obligation, is either Partial or Total, according as either part 01
1110 whole 01 the object of the first obligation is the object 01 the
second or additional obligation

(3) Of Partial intercessore we find an example within the limite
01 Italy, in 01010000 000 Fidepromissors under the operation of the
lex Furia. By this law the liubility of each sponsor was in inverse
ratio to their number, § 121. Whether an Italian Sponsor who had
not availed himself 01 the limitation 01 his liability under the lex
Furia was entitled 10 Regressus under the older lex Appuleia, was
a matter 01 controversy, ibid.

Total Intercession is divided, according as several debtors are
bound by one single obligation or several distinct, though similar,
obligations, into two classes, 0011001111 0110 Solidarity, terms which
have been explained above

0011001111 10 0000111000 1010 two classes, according as all the
debitores are equally principale and originally interested, 01 00010 010
principal and others only subsidiary or accessory. But in respect 01
1110 right 01 suing 01 1101111111 10 110 0000, the accessory, e. g. the lide-
jussor before the beneficium excussionis or ordinis was allowed him,
may bein the same position 00 the principal.

0011001111 in which all the debtors are interested 00 principale
has no specific name. As Intercession has been defined to be the
assumption 01 00 01100 debt (aliena obligatio), this 0011001111ἰο 1101
00100100 01 Intercession.

between the principa] and each Fidejussor, but also between the
several Fidejussors. This 10 denied by Savigny, Law of Obligations,
1 25, who 0000110 that though there 10 0011001111 between the
principal and each Fidejussor there is none between the several
Fidejussors: but Vangerow truly observes, 1573, that 11 the obliga-
tion 01 each Fidejussor 10 identical with the obligation 01 the
principal it follows, by the fundamental axium 01 syllogism, that
the obligations of the several Fidejussors are identicsl with one
another: in other words, that there is 0011001111 between the several
Fidejussors. Fidejussors have Beneficium divisionis by the epistle
01 Hadrian, § 121, Beneficium excussionis by Novella 4 01 J ustinian,
and Beneficium cedenderum actionum. 11 he neglected to avail
himself 01 these, a Fidejussor, like other correal debtors, had 110
regressus against his oofidejussors, Dig. 46, 1, 39.
