rules of these two kinds of tenure had been entirely assimilated.
Ager vectigalis was land leased by a municipality, or a sacerdotal
college, or the Vestal Virgine in perpetuity, or for long terms of
years, for a rent (vectigal) either in money or in produce, usually
amounting to one fifth orons seventh of the profits. This kind of
lease, as we have already seen, was subsequently extended to imperial
lande let out for cultivation (agri emphyteuticarii). Emphyteusis
was tregentos land in perpetuity‚ or for a term of years, for au
annual rent, subject to forfaiture, without claim for melioratione, on
non-payment of rent by the emphyteuta for three years, or for two
years if the land was held of the church. Laud held in emphyteusis
was alienable, devisable, descendible by intestucy. The proprietor,
however, had a right of pre-emption.

Emphyteusis resembled locatio-conductio in that the property
remained in the grantor, tc whom a rent was payable and who in
certain events might recover the land; it resembled emptio venditio
in that the grantes acquired not only detention of the land granted,
like the hirer (colonus), but aleo possession, properly so called, and
aproprietary right (jus in re) that nearly amounted to property or
dominium and could be maintained by actio vectigalis, a real action
against all the world, including the landlord himself.

Zeno (an. 475-491) decided that Emphyteusis was a contract sui
generis, distinct from both locatio and venditio, and requiring for its
validity‚ at least where the parties contracted themselves out of the
rules generally applicable, to be reduced to writing, (lod. 4, 66, Inst.
3, 24, 3. As to the application of the principle res perit domino to
this relation, see Inst. 1. c.

Like pignus, emphyteusis is a combination of jue in personam and
jus in rem; it was created by agreement without having to be followed
by delivery. cf. Windsoheid, Pand. 1 § 221.

§146 Gladiators were either (1) prisoners of war, ‘butchered to
make a Roman holidoy,’ or slaves who had committed some ottones,
1 § 13, or criminals under a capital sentence; or ¹(2) freemen who
voluntarily adopted the profession and hired themselves out (au-
ctorati, 3 t 199) to persons who maintained troops or companies
(ludi familiae) of gladiatore, either to make a profit, or to win the
favour of the public, by their exhibition. The first gladiatorial
show at Rome was exhibited a o. 264. 'I'he passion of the populace
for these exhibitione in the palmy days of Rome amounted to
a mania; and a vast revolution in public sentiment was implied
in their suppression, mn. 325, by the following constitution of
Constantine, Ood. 11, 44. ‘Exhibitions of bloodehed are out of
place in the reign of law aud the bosom of afatherland; and
gladiatorial shows, therefore, are absolutely prohibited’
