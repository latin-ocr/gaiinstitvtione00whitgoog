the greater force that is conceded temere agreement (nuda voluntas)
in modern jurisprudenae.

With the Romans the execution by one of the parties of his
part of an Innominate eontraet was essential to ita efficacy. This
execution differentiated the agreement from a nudum pactum and
garait validity, but, naturally, only against the party who had
failed to make the return promised. The party who had executed
was not similarly bound: he had a right of abandoning the contraet
and recovering back what he had delivered, not merely when the
counterexecution was not made at the time appointed, or had
become impossible hythe culpa of the other party, or had been
always impossible (condictio ob causam non secutam) 3 but when the
party who had delivered simply changed his inclination (condictio ex
mera poenitentia).

This was due to the exclusive character of the Roman contract
system. We find on the contrary in modern Roman law, as it was
in force in parts ol Germany before the new civil code was anacted,
pactum treated aa ii it had been accompanied by stipulation, that
is, as having the validity given by Form-in other words, no pacta
are nuda, all are vestita-and so agreements are enforceable irrespec·
tively of their pertexecutionr enforceable irrespeotively of execution
against both parties alike, who herein stand on precisely the same
footing: that is to say, the party who has delivered what he had
to deliver hae no right to recover it back either ex mera poenitentia,
or ob causam non secutam, but merely the power to compel the
other party to a corresponding periormance, Vangerow, § 599.
