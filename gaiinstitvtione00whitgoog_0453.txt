condemned, the obligation arising
from joindarof issueisdischarged,
and a new obligation arises from
the judgment. Hence the say·
ing 11 theold jurists‚ that, before
action brought, a debtor is bound
to pay his debt; aiter joinder 11
issue he ie bound by the con·
damnatio 11 the formula; after
condemnation passed, he 11 bound
to satisfy the judgment.

§ 181. Accordingly, after suing
bystatutableaction,theextinction
of the original obligation disables
me by strict law from bringing 1
second action, for the declaration
that the defendant isbcund to
convey something 11 me 11 false,
11 joinder 11 11111 11 the first
action terminated his obligation.
It is otherwise 111 sued at first by
an 111111 depending on the execu-
tive power (imperium) 11 the prae
tor, 4§ 105. For then the original
obligation continues, and so, ac?
cording to strict law, its non·
extinction permits me to bring
a second action; but 1 may 11

repelled bytho exception 11 pre·
vicus judgment (res judicata) or
previous joinder 11 11111 (res in
judicium deducta). What actions

are statutable, and what deter-
. mine with (or, derivo their force
from) the praetor’s executive
power, will be explained in the
next book 11 these Institutas.

§ 168. Gaius only considers at present the modes 11 extinguishing
an obligatior, i. 1. the modes whereby an obligation ceases to exist.
In the next book, 4 5115, he will treet 11 the exceptio, that is 11 say,
a defence to an action whereby, though the right of the plaintiff con·
tinues to exist, it is deprived 11 its operation by being confronted
with an adverse right 11 the defendant3 which defence required to
11 alleged with the perrnission 11 111 praetor in 1 special clause 11
the formula called the exceptio.
