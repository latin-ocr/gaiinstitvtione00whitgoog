difficilis, 31 whom 131 fragments are preserved: and, lastly, our
author, Gaius, who flourished under Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and
Marcus Aurelius, and from whose writings 5³5 extracta are to be
found in the Digest

If we now inquire whether this divergenoe 31 schools was based
on any differenoe of principle, 1113 answer is, No: on none, at least,
that modern commentatore have succeeded in discovering: it was
merely a differance on a multitude 'of isolated points 31 detail. We
313 told indeed that the founders vvere men 31 dissimilar characters
and intellectual dispositione: 11131 Labeo was characterized by bold·
ness 31 logio and a spirit 31 innovation; while Capito 1331311 311
tradition and authority, and inclined 13 33333113113111, Dig. 1, 2, 473
but it is altogether impossible to 11333 their opposing tendencies in
the writings of their successore: 31111 we must suppose that the
intellectual impulse given by Labeo was communicated to the fol-
lowers 31 both schools 31 jurisprudence. But though, as we have
stated, no differenoe 31 principle was involved, each school was
accustomed to follow its leaders or teochers (praeceptores) with much
servility; and it is quite an exception to find, on a certain question,
Cassius, amember 311113 Sabinian school, following the opinion of
Labeo; while Proculus, who gave his name 13 Labeo’s school, pre·
ferred the opinion of Ofilius, the toacher of Capito, 351403 Gaius

, too, who was a Sabinian, sometimes inclines to 1113 opinion of

the rival school: ot 3, t 98. controversias between the two schools
are referred to by Gaius in the following passages of his Institutas:
1, 1963 2, 15, 31, 13, 133, ros, 200, aro-222, 231, 244: 3, 31, 33,
133, 141,131-3,111-3; 4,13-3, 114, 170.

As long as these schools 31 law, which may have derived their
constitution from the Greek schools of philosophy, existed, the office
31 Ρ1331113111 appears to have devolved by succession from one jurist
to another. (For an account of this subject and references to the
chief modern writers who have discussed it see Sohm, pp. 98, dic.)

We may briefly mention some of the most illustrious jurists who
flourished somewhat later than Gaius. Aemilius Papinianus, who
was probably a Syrien, lived in the time 31 Septimius Severus, 31111
was murdered by the order of Caracalla: 601 extracta from his
writings are contained in 1113 Digest. It was perhaps to some
extent due to the transcendent genius, or 31 least 13 the 311113-
ordinary reputation, of Papinian, which made him seem too great
to be reolroned any man’s follower, that we cease about his time to
⁵ hear of opposing schools ofjurisprudence. Papinian appears to have
aocompanied Severus to York, fulfilling the important fonction 31
praefectus praetorio, so that England may claim some slight con·
naaion with the brightest luminary of Roman law.
