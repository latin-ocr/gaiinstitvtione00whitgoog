'rho purchase cf the wife by the husband, a widespread custom in a
primitive state oi society, was no doubt one of theways inwhich Roman
marriage originated. The exact naturaei Ooemption, in consequence
oi the defective state oi the veronese manuscript, must, however,
romain a mystery. Ooemption was a form oi mancipation,§ 113, but
in virtue of the provision of the Twelve Tables, Cum nexum faciet
mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto, the nature cf every
mancipation depended on the mancipii lex, the acoompanying nuncu·
pation or verbal declaration of its condition, intentione, purposes; as
in English conveyancing the nature ol a grant is limitcd and deter-
mined by the habendum and tenendum of the dead. We are intormed
that in coemption, the formula was not the same asin other mancipa-
tions,§ 123, but we are not infcrmcd what it was. Even in Cicero’s
time many advocates were ignorant of the legal effect of a coempticn
because they were ignorantes the precise tsrms of the formula in
which it was concluded, De Orat l, 56. 'l'he word iteeli may suggest
a conjecture that it was a conveyance of the husband to the wife as
well aa oi the wife to the husband ; and this is supported by Servius
on Georgics, l, 34, and Isidorus, 5, 24, no great authorities, but who
quoted apparently from Ulpian: ‘An ancient nuptial form wherein
husband and wife made a mutual purchase, to bar the inierance
that the wife became a slave.’ Plutarch informs us that the wife
asserted her equality by the terms, Ubi tu Gaius, ego Gaia, Quaest
Rom 28: ‘Where thou art master,1am mistress? Boethius on
Cicero, Topica, 3, 14, quoting irom Ulpian, says: ‘Theman and
woman interrogated one another. He asked her if she wished to
be mother of his household; she answered, Yes. She cskod him
if he wished to be father of her household; he answered, Yes.
And thus the woman passed into the hand oi the man, and was
called the mother of his household, with the status of filiafamilias!
According to Cicero, the wife was only called matonamiliae when
subject to hand: Genus est uxor; ejus duae formae; una matrum·
familias, eae sunt, quae in manum convenerunt, altera earum quae
tantummodo uxores habentur, Top. 3, 14. Gellius says the same,
18, 6, 7: Tradiderunt matremfamilias appellatam esse eam solam
quae in mariti manu mancipioque autin ejus, in cujus maritus mann
mancipioque esset. Boethius (inGio.'I¹op.3,14) further limits the
title to awife who has become subject tc manus by coemption:
Quae autem in manum per coemptionem convenerant, hae matres·
familias vocabantur, quae vero usu et farreatione, minime, ibid.
However this may have been, in one sense the name was a mis·
nomer, for a wil'e subject to hand was not suijuris (materfamilias),
but alieni juris (filiafamiliaslt and that materfamiliae denoted a
woman sui juria, whether married or unmarried, aa opposed to
