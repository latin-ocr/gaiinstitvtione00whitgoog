long after the middle oi 1110 second century no. The leges J uliae
are supposed to be leges judiciariae passed by Augustus. Whatwere l
the respective shares 01 these different enactments in bringing about
the importent change of procedure Gaius mentions must remain
uncertain. After the legis actiones were abolished as modes 01 010
ceeding in civil suits their forms still survived in the ceremonias 01
adoption, the manumission 01 0 slave, the emancipation 01 0 son,
and conveyance by in jure cessio.

It may be questioned whether Gaius has exactly laid his finger
011 the deficiency 01 the system 01 Statuteprocess when he alleges r
its excessivo formalism or subtlety (nimia subtilitas) as the cause 01 ⁴
its failure. Its shortcoming was not so much its formalism (1110 ¹
following system was equally formalistic) as (1) its 110111 01 saie·
guards against errore 01 form and (2) its want 01 power of expansion

(1) Though the Formula was perhaps as literally and rigorously
interpreted 01 1110101111 01 statute-process, yet the period at which
the Formula was fixed in the Formulary system diminished the
danger 01 the defeat 01 0 righful claim by an error in the selection
01 the appropriate 101111. Τ110101111110010110011011 was not de·

· Statuteprocess was formal 01 01 0011101 stage and from the inception
01 the proceedings: and the kinds of statute-process were specially
characterized and denominated by their first stages 01011 when 111010
were extrajudicial or cutside the court, as in manus injectio and
pignoris 00010. In 810111001000110110110101101111 01 any 011110

' asuicidal error—no form was fixed whereby his claim could be

defeated-before the litis contestatio.
