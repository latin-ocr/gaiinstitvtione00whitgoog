384 DE OBHGATIONIBVS [111. §p 155-162.

creditor, e. g. ιο compensation, or set-off of a debt, which the creditor
owed the debtor; to exceptio non-numeratae pecuniae; and to an
exception instituted by the lex Anastasiana, shortly before the time
of J ustinian, to stop the buying of claime for small sums, a statute
which prevented any purchaser ol a debt from recovering more than
the price at which it was actually purchased. And similar objec-
tions might be raised in respect ol any assignes intermediate between
the original assignor and the final assignes. Thus though the actio
utilis, no actio directe being possible, was brought in the name of
the assignes, it may still be held thet, according tc the Roman view,
it was only exercised in a kind of representative capacity, the bare
obligation itseli remaining with the original creditor. The complete
transferability of obligations was unknown ιο jurisprudence until
the law merchant gave validity to mercantile instrumente, such as
bille of erchange, passing freely from hand ιο hand 3 in other words,
to papers payable ιο the Holder or Bearcr, 2 § 259, comm.

In euch papers the jus in personam is, as it were, incorporated
in the document thus made frealy assignabis, the holder of an
instrument of this‘kind being able ιο recover on it, although the
person from whom he received it may not have been able ιο do so.
We have instances of such papers (called negotieble) in Promiseory
Notes, Bills of Exchange, State obligations (documents expressing
aclaim against a government for a certain amount of capital debt,
and having annexed to them caupone, representing claime of
periodic interest), and some Debentures of industrial corporations
(certificatos of Shares in such industrial companies, though similar
to Debentures as entitling the Holder to certain dividends or shares
in the profits, are foreign to our present purpose, because they
essentially and originally relate to Property or jus in rem, not ιο
Obligation or jus in personam, the Shareholders being coproprietors).
Bytho use of such negotiable papers the transferability ol Obligation
is raised to a level with the transferability of Ownership, Savigny,
Obligationcnrecht, 62-70. Itis to be remembered that the cession
or assignment of which we have been speaking is a succession ιο
a particular right, and is not ιο be confounded with the general
assignment of rights and obligations in a successio per universitatem.
(lession or assignment is in the etrict sense the act of the creditor, but
rights of action may also be transferred from one person ιο another
by dscree of 'a court or by the direct operation of a rule of law.

ξ 161. 'l'he doctrine cl Sabinus that if an agent exceed his
powers in the price at which he purchases, the principal is not
bound for the purchasemoney even alter deduction of the un·

authoriaed arceas, was not allowed to prevail, as we are informed by
J ustinian. See Inst. 3, 26, 8.
