re praejudicium hereditati non fiat, § 133, 01 exceptio praejudicialis,
0301110 quamsi in reum capitis praejudicium fist, (lic. de Inven-
tione, 2, 20; 10. dilatory pleas whereby a party seeks to postpone
a 1000 important issue (causa minor) until a more important issue
(01101 major) with which it is indissolubly connected shall have
been decided This praescriptio implies that 11 themora important
10010 were decided on possibly inadequate examination, 10 incidental
or ancillary 10 the decisicn of the minor issue, the 1011111 01 the
more important issue would be barrad by the exceptio rei judicatae.
Observe that the rulo is, a judgment shall not be contradicted by
a judgment in another action when the same right is in question,
not, when the same title is in question. 'Phe latter expression would
be sufficient to meet the 0100 01 personal actions Here every
different obligatior is ground to support a different action, and every
different title engenders a 1111101011 obligation. 'l'hus a plaintiff who
11110 in an action on tort alleging Dolus is not precluded from a
subsequent action 011 1011 11103113 Culpa, Dig. 40, 12, 13. Β11 the
’ 11110 00 stated would not adequatelymeet the 0100011011 actions.
Here itis immaterial that the plaintiff alleges a different title. There
can be many obligations between the same parties in respect 01 the
sams subjeot; but the same subject only admits 01 oue owner, aiud
consequently of only one valid title to ownership. nme the plaintiff
in a roal 101101 was required 10 adduce all his fancied 111100 01 pain
01 being barred by the exception 01 100 judicata, and 11, 10111011100,
he claime ownership on the ground oi tradition he cannot afterwards
claim by another title, 03. usucapion, § 1310. A man who 11110 11
1 claim as testamentary heir may, however, afterwards claim as heir
by desoent, Dig. 5, 3, 8: he has 10 many actions (hereditatis petitio)
as he has delations: in fact the legaeies and the arbitrary division 01
the succession between the co·heirs make a testamentary inheritancs

(causa superveniens), and it is defeated if the plaintiff lakes the
precaution expressly 10 limit the former action (probably by means
01 1 praescriptio) to the investigation 01 0 speoific title, a limitation
called causae adjectio. If he was allowed bytho praetor to do this
and failed in hie suit, he could afterwards claim 10 be owner bya
different title. Si quis petat fundum suum 0000 00, quod Titius eum
sibi tradiderit, si postea alia ex causa petat 01101 adjecta, non debet
summoveri exceptione, Dig. 44, 2, 11, 2. ‘A plaintiff who 10000 an
action in which he claimed property in laud on the ground 01 de-
livery 01 possession, isnot barred by exception 110111 bringing another
real action, expressly limited, like the former, to a specific 11110·
