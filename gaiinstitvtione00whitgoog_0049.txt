THE PRINCIPATE xliii

jnn'st still plays a leading part in legal progress. His control ef
the Princeps, and tho Princeps’ control ef him, must beth be taken
into account, although the actual extent ef the respective influenees—
ei the administrator over the jurist and of tho jurist ever the adminis-
trater-can never be determined for any giren act er fer any given

’ moment ef time.

A division of power el this type is perhaps common to all
monarchies. But in the Reman Principate, which was not tsch-
nieally a monarchy‚ we find it expressed in yet another way-a way
which is of more impertance theoretically‚ although perhaps el less
practical impert It is expressed in the ferm that the Princeps is
merely the ‘extraordinary magistrate’ osa Republiean Constitutien.
By an ‘extraordinary magistracy' is meant a magistracy formed by
an accumulatien ef functione, each oi which is usually exercised by
a particular magistrate. The chief powers with which the Princeps
was invested were the Proconsulare Imperium conferred by the
Senate, and tho Tribunicia Potestas conferred en a recommendatien
oi the Senate in aformal meeting ef the People. The Proconsulare
Imperium was technically valid only outside the limite of Italy 3 but,
as it was absolutely necessary that the Princeps should possess
Imperium within Rome, he war specially exempted from lesing his
Imperium by his presence within the city. The effect of this
exemption probably was to create fer the Princeps a kind ef consular
Imperium in Rome and Italy. Buteven this device was net sufficient
te secum for him the authority which he required aa a moderatores
the whole State. The Proconsulare Imperium and the Tribunicia
Potestas required to be supplemented by a number ef separate powers
cenferred by special granis. These granta must originally have been
made by special laws and decrees ei the Senate that were passed at
various times ; but the practice seems soon to have been adopted ef
embodying them in asingle enactment‚ which was submitted te the
formal assent ei the People at the time when the Proconsulare
Imperium and the Tribunicia Potestas were conferred. A fragment
ol such an enactment is the extant Lex er senatusconsultum which
enumeratos powers conferred en the Emperor Vespasiae at his
accession ¹. 'Phe rights of the Princeps enumerated in this document
are ei a very heterogenseus kind-they include the powers of making
treaties, extending the ponerem ef the eity, cemmending candidates
