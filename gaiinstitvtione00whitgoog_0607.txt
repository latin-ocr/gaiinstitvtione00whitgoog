1011110411] AOE'IONES TEMPORALES 547

01 action such prescription hes this pecuherity, that it cannot be
0100101 generally, but only by 0 defendant, who has been in 000000-
sionei 1110 01000110 10 question for the prescribed period. Thus
being 0 1010000 founded 00 possession, and not simply on the owner’s
omission to bring his 00110011 comes 10 0 great extent under the
category 01 substantive lew. ,

Longi temporis praescriptio was applicable as 0 defense 001 only tc
actions 0100 owner cleiming possession of his property, but also
tc those relating 10 1110 existence 01 0 servitude, and though 0 lex
Scribonia 10 0011 10 heve done swsy with the 1100000100 01 0010110100,
in 10101 imperial law praescriptio became 0 01010 01 ecquiring
servitudes, as it was 01 acquiring ownership. In the thirteenth
century 1110 canon law required ass condition both 01 acquisitive 001
01 0111001100 010001101100, 10 all 00000 brought 101 1001111111οο 01 pos·
session, continued bona fides (not merely bona fides in the inception,
as the civil law required for usucapion) 011 the 0011 01 1110 possessor.
This principle applied to the defendant in all real actions 00110
various persensi actions, 011. commodati, depositi, locati, pignoraticia,
the 101101 being 1110 action whereby a person who 1101 given 0001 his
property in pledge 10 his creditore sued on the contract 101110
restitution. Accordingly, by 00000 lew, 1110 10111011010110000, 0 g.
rei commodatae, es opposed to the debitor rei propriso, 0. g. pecuniae
01011100, had neither the right 01 acquisitive nor 01 0111001100 prescrip·
tion in the absence of continued bons fides. Savigny, § 244.

In every limitation 0100 action 010100011011011, whether of longer
01 01101101 10101100, two points 11000 10 be fixed: the moment 01
which the time 01 0100011011οο begins to run and the moment at which
itis terminated. Iproceed to 1110 consideration 01 this problem.

The date 01 1110 Nativity 01 0 right oi action (00110 nata),cr 1110
moment from which prescription begins to run, is in Resl actions
1110 moment when 0 Resl right is violated; e. g. the moment when
the defendant takes unpermitted possession 01 0 thing 01 which the
plaintiff is proprietor; 01 when 0111101011101100001000001101010011011.
1010 possession by beginning to possess in his own name 001 001 111
the 00100 01 the proprietor.

In Personsl action cn delict prescription begins to run from the
moment 01 1110 delict; for at this moment the sanctioning right 01
the plaintiff tc 1000001 1110 penalty is complete.

Similsrly in Quasi-contracte: 0100011011οο 01 tutelsejudicium begins
to 10011001 1110 001 01 the guardianship when the tutor's defeult is
established: thet of condictio indebiti 1101011101010 011110 1010101100
psyment.

In actions on Ocntreot, according to most writers including
flavigny, prescription similarly begins to run 1101111110 moment 01
