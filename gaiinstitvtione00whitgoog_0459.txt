sumption of a right of aetion (litis consumptio) which has just been
described: the barring of any subsequent suit in virtue of the maxim:
De eadem re ne bis sit actio, Quintilian, 7, 6, 1, either by extinction
(ipsc jure) or by counteraction (opo exceptionis) of the plaintifi's right
to sue. This occurred, as we shall see, 4 § 103, even when in conse·
quence of process-prescription there was no judgment, or when, by
reason of Plus petitio or some dilatory plea, there was a judgment
against the plaintiff but not upon its merite. The operation was
gradually abrogated before the time of Justinian, only leaving
traces of itself in the Novatio necessaria, which extinguished indeed
civilis obligatio but left a naturalis obligatio, sufficient tc support
the pignora or hypothecae by which the plaintiff was protected.
Processual consumption had only considered the Intentio of the
action that was btought: the exceptio rei judicatae, by which in
later times the same or similar objecta were accomplished‚ regarded
the exact import of the Sentent‘ . The most signal departure from
the principle of processual consumption was perhaps Justinian's
constitution, God. 8, 40, 28, concerning Ocrreality and Fidejussio,
§§ llo-127, comm. As Correality is a single obligaticn imposed on
several debtors, a suit against one extinguished the obligation of the
remainder: e. g. acuit brought against a principat extinguished
the right cf suing the surety‚ and vice versa Justinian enacted
that the obligation of the remaining correal debtors should not bo
extinguished even by judgment against one, but only by complete
satisfaction cf the plaintiffs claim.

2. (a) Litis contestatio, in the classical period, by interrupting
Proscription, 4 tt 110-113, conrm, saved the plaintifi's title from being
barred by lapse citime. Ata later period, Proscription was inter·
rupted by a still earlier event, Insinuatio or registration in court.
As soon as Proscription of the right of action was thus interrupted,
Prescription cf pendency began to run, 4 ἐξ 104, 105.

Mor-cover, respecting the plaintitl's 'l'itle cr ground of action it is a
general rule that no causa superveniens, cr entitling event, subsequent
tc Litis contestatio can avait to save the plaintiff from losing the
action already brought, though it ma'y give him the right tc bring
another. Further‚ as a general rule, tho ground of action must not
only exist before Litis contestatio but must continuo up tc con-
demnatio. Otherwise in virtue of the maxim: Omnia judicia esse
absolutoria, though there was a difference of opinion between the
Sabinians and Proculians on this point, 4 ξ 114, the defendant will
bo absolved. Ε. g. if the defendant in a condictio furtiva was a con·
ditional legates cf the thing which he has stolen from the heir who
sues him for damages, and the condition is fulfilled after Litis
contestatio, the defendant is acquitted, Dig. 13, 1, 14, pr.
