those which weighed upon infames: until by a change in political
conceptione these inequalities of right have been again lavelled and
almost obliterated in most of the codes of modern Europe. See also
the remarks on colonatus, 3 ξ 145.

ξ 162. In the category of domestic position there are three classes,
(1) sui juris, or paterfamilias and materfamilias3 (a) filiusfamilias
and filiafamilias3 and (3) mancipium: but there are only two possible
degradatione, (ι) from sui juris to alieni juris, which occurs in
adrogation and the in manum conventio of a woman previously
independent; and (a) from filius· or filiafamilias to mancipium,
which occurs in noxal surrender, in emancipation, ln adoption
as implying mancipation, and in the remancipation of a woman by
her husband or tha person who held her in manu in virtue of a
fiduciary coemption. 'Phe descent from sui juris to mancipium
cannot occur, because the only persons capable of passing into the
condition of mancipium by the process of mancipation wore filius·
and filiafamilias and women in manu, ie. persons already alieni

In the exposition of capitis minutio, and particularly of the third
and last kind, Ihave adopted the theory of savigny as being the
most tenable, and forming the most harmonicus system of legal
conceptione I must now briefly notice an opposing theory, and
tho objections that may be raised against that of Savigny. Some
expositore hold that capitis minutio minima did not necessarily and
essentially involve any degradation, any downward step on the
ladder of status, but might be merely a horizontal morament on the
same platform, a transit from family to family, a disruption of
the ties of agnation, acessation oi membership in a given civil
group. (See on this subject Dr. Moyle’s Excursus, Inst Blr. l, and
Professor Goudy's App. to Muirhead's Roman Law, second ed, p. 426,
where Mommsen's explanation is given.) This opinion is founded
on the authority of Paulus, undeniably an eminent juris auctor,
who detines tho least diminution of head as follows: Dig. 4, 5, ll.
‘capital diminution is of three orders, greatest, minor, least; as
there arc three things that we hare, liberty, citizenship, family.
'The universal loss of freedom, citizenship, family, is the greatest
capital diminution; loss of citizenship while liberty is retained is
minor capital diminution ; when liberty and citizenship are retained,
and family onlyis changed, there is the least capital diminution!
Consistently with thie definition Paulus affirms that the children
of adrogatus suffer capitis minutio minima: Dig. 4, 5, 3pr. ‘The
children who follow an adrogated parent suffer capital diminution,
as they are dependent and have changed family’: here, then, if
Paulus is rfght, we have capitis minutio without any degradation,
