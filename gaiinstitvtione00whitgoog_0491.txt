possidetis, and Unde vi. This would agree with the Roman arrange-
ment: at least the Roman jurists, instead of treating possession by
the side of ownership, possession being the actual control ofa thing
as owner, while ownership is the legal right to such control, were
content with regarding Dispossession as a ground of liability, im·
posing a secondary positive obligation on the individue] dispossessor,

But the true place of Possession seems indicated by Vangerow,
who distinguishes between the Interdiota Retinendae and Recu-
perandae possessionis The Interdictum Recuperandae possessionis,
ia Interdiot Unde vi, is really based on something analogous to
a delict, and might perhaps have been ascribed to delictal law:
whereas Possession, as contemplatod by the Interdicis Retinendae
possessionis, i.e. the Interdicis Uti possidetis and Utrubi, is pro-
tected as isit were a primnry right demanding universal recognition
(jus in rem) that has its place in connexion with the law regulating
Dominium: and the interdiots allotted for its protection, though
perhaps nominally based on acts of a delictal character, are really
coordInate not with delictal actions, but with Real actions or
vindicatio. Gaius only deals with Possession and possessor-y Inter-
dicts as belonging to the code of Procedure, without indicating their
position in the code of Substantias law.
