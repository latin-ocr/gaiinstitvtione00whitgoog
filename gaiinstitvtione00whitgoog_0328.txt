executor and, unless the attestation clause is in a certain form, by
the affidavit of one of the subscribing witnesses; or, if the validity
of the will is disputed‚ by examination of the witnesses orr cath in
the presence of the parties interested. The will itself is deposited
in the registry of the Ocurt oi Probate; a copy of it iu parchment,
under the seal of the court of Probata, delivered to the executor
along with a certificate of proof, is the only proper evidence of his
right to intermeddle with the personal estate of the testator.

The following were the corresponding formalitiee of Roman law
prescribed by lex J ulia vicesimanis: Paulus, Sent. Rec. 4, 6:—

‘A will is opened in the following manner: the witnesses, or the
majority, who affixed their seals, are summoned and ackuowledge
their scala, the cord is broken, the tablets are opened, the will is'
read, a copy is taken, a public seal is affixed to the original, and it
is deposited in the archives, so that if the copyis ever lost there
may be a means of making another.

‘In municipalities, colonies, towns, profecturos, wicks, matins,
market towns, awill must be read in the forum or basilien, iu the
presence of the attesting witnesses or of respectable persons, between
eight o’clock in the morning and four o’clock in the aftemoon; and,
as soon as a copy has been made, must be scaled up again by the
magistrats in whose presence it was opened.

‘A will is intended by the law to be opened immediately aiter
the death ο1 the testatem accordingly, though rescripte have varied,
it is now the rulo that if all the parties are present, three or five
days is the interval within which the tablets must be opened; if
they are absent, the same number of days after they are assembled;
in order that heire, legatees‚ manumitted slaves, and the military
treasury (entitled, 3 § 125, to vicesima hereditatum, i. e. 5 per cent.
on the value of Roman citizens' testamentary successione), may come
into their rights without unnecessary delay.'

In cases of urgency, when the will was opened in the absence
of the attesting witnesses in the presence of respectable persons, it
was afterwards forwarded to the witnesses for the verification 91
their seals, Dig. 29, 3, 7. Every one who desirsd it had the power
of inspecting a will and taking a copy, Dig. 29, 3, 8.
