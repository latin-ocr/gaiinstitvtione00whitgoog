interdictum Salvianum (5 147; Inst 4, 15, 3 ; Dig. 43, 33 ; God. 3, 9; ,
cf. Windscheid, § 236, n. 5) protects the landlord in the recovery οι l
his rent by preventing the tenant from taking away his goods from ι
the promises demised. l

(ι) In the law of inheritancs we have the interdicts Quorum
bonorum, ι 144 ,Dig. 43, 2, and Quod legatorum, Dig. 43, 3,Ι ιιι aid 013
the praetorian successor and heir.

D. In the lswof Procedure we havet the interdicts Quem fundum, 3
Quam hereditatem, Quem usumfruct tum, ι 89, and the interdicte
Secundaria, ξ 170, compelling a defendant ιιι ι restitutory or ex· ,
hibitory interdict to defend himself ιιιι the mode prescribed by the 3
law under pain of forfeiting possession Here too we may place the
int terdicta Utrnbi and Uti possidetis, so far as they are not themselves
final suits but only means of determining provisional or interimistic ¹
possession during the pendency of the definitive vindicatio: and hen
too, if we loolr on Quorum bonorum as standing ιο hereditatis petilio =
in the same relation ln which Uti possidetis stands to vindicatio, ia
as merely properatory to the final suit, we may place the interdict
Quorum bonorum. At a later stage ol proceedings the interdict lle
vis fiat ei, quiin possessionem missus erit, Dig. 43, 4, protects the
creditor who has obtained execution. 'Phe interdictum fraudatorinm
protecte the creditor against fraudulent alienation hyan insolvent
debtor, Dig. 42, 8: the interdictum possessorium and interdictum ³
sertorium, ξι 145, 146, protect the purchaser ol the estate of the
insolvent or the condemned criminal.

As ιιι alternative ιο some of these interdicte, the pleintiff had his
option of *an actio infactum: eg. an alternative to interdictum
Salvianum was actio Serviane, Inst. 4, 6, 7 ; and ιιι eltemative ιο
interdictum haudatorium was actio Pauliana, Dig. 22, 1, 38, 4. Or
possibly in these cases also the Interdict was the provisional, the
Action the definitive proceeding.

,ι 140. Restituere in respect of the acts which it denotes is a word
of many meanings, and comprehende several acts which in physiral
character have little in common but the name. Sometimes it means
the restoration of an unlewful structure to its original condition: e g.
Quod in flumine publico ripave ejus fiat, sive qnid in id flumen
ripamve ejus immissum habeas, qno statio iterve navigio deterior sit,
fiat, restituas, Dig. 43, 12, 1, 19. ‘What you have built in apublic
river οι on its bank, or what you have discharged into the river or on
to its bank, interiering with the anchorago or passage of vessels I
command you to reestablish.’ Sometimes it means the restoration of
possession, as ιιι the interdict Unde vi, ξ 154 3 sometimes the delivery
of possession, where no possession has preceded, es in the interdict

Quorum bonorum, § 144. But in spite of the variety of physical acts
