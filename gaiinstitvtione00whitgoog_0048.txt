xlii HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION

Principale wee in the nature of en excrescence-one thet was
probably beelthy in its effecte, in spite of the fect thet it does seem
to heve limited to e certain extent the creetive activities of juristio
thought. The birth of the Principete wes not conditioned by strictly
legel necessities. There seems to here been little sense thet e single
controlling force was needed for the guidenoe oi the lew ot Rome,
Italy, end the provinces. The justificetion for the Principete was
found in the fect thet e single controlling power wes necessary for
the command of the army end the routine administration of the
provinces But it wes impossible to oreste such e power without
bringing it into some conteot with every department of the Stete.
The guidence of legislation end judicaturo by en individual will wes
s necessary outcome of the new order of things, end itis possible
thet this guidence was needed. There is e stege in the history of
lew where liberty of interpretation may lead to perplexing un·
certainty, end there is e stage in the history of eny national judicial
organization where certain redicol methods ere necessary to edept
it to new needs. The Principete gere e definiteness to lew, but
e definiteness that was in no sense illiberel. On the contrary, it
prevented lew from being narrowly Romen es effectuelly as it
cheolred it from recklessly ebsorbing foreign elements It adopted
lew to provincial needs by expanding, but not impeiring, its netionel ¹
chereoter. At the seme time it widened the scope oi jurisdiction by
methods which we shall soon describe-methods which seem to heve
increased the efficiency at least of the civil courts et Rome, and
which brought the provincial world into closer judicial relations
with the capital. The changes effected both in legislation end in
jurisdiction were gredual end progressiv03 end, though they were
from aformal point oi view initieted by the will of individuel
monarche, it is importent to remember thet, et Rome es elsewhere,
monarchicnl power is the outcome of the concurrence of meny
individuel wills For the sake of convenience we ere accustomed
to treet the Princeps es the chief source of lew end the chief
influence on jurisdiction. Sometimes a purely personel power oi
this type mey heve been reelized for e while, although when so
reelized it alweys hed e flevour of tyrenny ¹. But es a rulo, when
we think of the Princeps es a source of lew and justice, we should
be thinking of his judiciel advisere end assessore The trained

sourcesybut the method eiustatement is likely to eonvey e false historioel
¹³¹¹pi¹v⁰2tffii¹y afficite hide Ἢ of Caligula on tae rus responaens or ue surn-
eonsults Suetonius says (Golia. 34) ‘ De juris quoque consultis, qussi scientiae
eorum omnem usum aboliturus, reepe jactarit “se mehercule effecturum no

quid respondere possint prester eum.”' This wne a desire thet iound no
rulfflment during the Principete.
