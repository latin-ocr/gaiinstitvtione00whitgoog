58. In Justinian’s time it was fully established that the penalty
oi Rapina was only thrice the value of the thing taken with violence,
that is, the quadrupla damagee were partly penal and partly repara·
tory; accordingly the actions vi bonorum raptorum and the red or
personal action te recover the thing taken or damagee could not aleo
be brought, that is they were not concurrent or cumulative, Inst
4, 6, 19. Foracaee oi quadruplo damages, oi which l was restoratiee

§ 9. The actio judicati wee brought against a defendant to enforce
'the condemnation oi the judex. Ii he defended thie action ha was
liable to be condemned to pay twice the amount of the judgment debr,
and was required to give security judicatum solvi. This secur-ily
was the modern representative of the interposition ofa Vindex in
theold proceeding oi manue injectio. In manus injectio pro judicato
it seems the Vindex who lost the suit was condemned, aa a penalty
for hia unwarranted interferenee to pay a sum equal to the original
judgmentdebt; inetherwords, to discharge the debtor he had to pay
twice the amount oi the debt. In manus injectio pure the defendant
was so to say his own Vindex, and, ii he lost, was condemned in
double the debt. See ξς 21-25.
