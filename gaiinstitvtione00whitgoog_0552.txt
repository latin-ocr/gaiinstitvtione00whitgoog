what was the true intention 01 the parties; he attends not only
to express but also to implied terme 01 an agreement, Dig. 3, ⁵,
6, and, to ascertain these, takes notice 01 local neeges, big 21,
1, 31, 20. As we distinguish between the manifestation 01 the will
or overt act 01 a delinquent and his intention, so bona fides distin·

guishes between the exact words used by contractors and their

intentione. Strictum jus adheres more rigidly, at least in carly
times, to a grammatical or literal interpretation 01 a disposition,
and assumes that words exactly cormepond to intentione It is than
called summum jus: e g. Verbis et literis et summo jure contenditur,
Cicero.

(o) ‘rho ground to support any given condictio or actio stricti juris
is precisely defined: whereas an actio bonae fidei, e. g. an aetio
empti or venditi, can be brought not only to enforce the principd
contraot—emptio venditio—but also tc enforce any accessory agree
ments made at the same time (ex continenti) as the principal continet
(pacta adjecta) or to obtain relief in respect 01 any circumstances
01 fraud (dolus) or intimidation (metus). In the later law, however,
accessory informal agreements coalesoed into a single contract evhss
annexed to a loan (mutuum): Omnia quae inseri stipulationibus
possunt, eadem possunt etiam numerationi pecuniae et ideo et con
ditiones, Dig. 12, 1, 7. In the case ola loon 01 money, however,
interest could not be recovered on a contemporaneous, informal agras
ment, because the only action a loen 01 money could support was oon·
dictio certae pecuniae: on a loan 01 any other quantitas but money,
such aa oil or wheat‚ interest could be recovered, because though the
intentio of the formula was certa, the velue of such things was
uncertain (condemnatio ineerta); but this exoeption to the rule that
interest could not be due on a mutuum seems only to have been
made, in lats times, a special stipulation on account 01 interest having
perhaps been required in all cases by classical law, Ood. ⁴, 32, 2&
cf. Dig. 50,16,121 Usura pecuniae, quam percipimus, in stum
non est, quia non ex ipso corpore, sed ex 0110001100 est, id est
nova obligatione. Savigny, § 268.

(d) The deience in an actio stricti juris could only allege marsa
which ipso jure extinguishsd or annihilatad a claim (e. g. solutio
acceptilatio, novatio), or, ifthey founded an indirect answor oi the
defendant, had been disclcsed to the praetor in the preliminary
pleadings (in jure) in the form 01 an exceptio: whereas the judex or
arbiter who tried an actio bonae fidei could consider any pleasin
exception even when they were averred for the first time in the
course 01 the trial: cum doli exceptio insit de dote actioni utin
ceteris bonae fidei judiciis, Dig. 24, 3, 21.
