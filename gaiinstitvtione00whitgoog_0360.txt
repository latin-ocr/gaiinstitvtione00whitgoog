'I'he patron's romedy by actio Fabiana and ectio Calvisiana may
be compared with the remedy by Querela inofficiosae donationis;
lor the rights oi a patron against the inheritance of the freedman
were somewhat analogous to the rights of certain very near relations
of the testator to his inheritance, unless a certain portion (debita,
legitima portio) of the inheritance was left them in his will, and by
the Querela inofficiosae donationis any gift he made which violated
his duty to such relations in this respect could be set asida. While
the will oi the freedman could be upset by contra-tabulation (by
interdictum quorum bonorum or petitio hereditatis possessoris), the
testator's near relatives were allowed tho Querela inofficiosi testamenti,
withafictitiousallegationofthetestator’s insanity. The amount held
sufficient to satisty the rights oi the two classes of claimants differod:
while the patron was entitled to ᾗ, or, in later times, ὲ of the inheri·
tanco, a will was set aeide for breach ot family respect (pietas) unless
a t of what would have been the quarelant’s share in the event of in·
testacy was left him. 111 both cases the will oi the testator, whether
libertus or ingenuus, might be allowedto stand, solaraswasconsistent
with the claims of the Querelant or Contra-tabulant3 but while
Contratsbulation necessarily produced a violation of the rule, nemo
pro parte testatus, pro parte intestatus, decedere potest, the Querela
only produced it occasionally, as it often caused a complete rescission
of the will, or total intestacy.- Praeteriti liberi, ie, neither instituti
heredes nor exheredati, could also, if the will was not on this
account entirely void, contratabulate like the patron: but the
patron’s ground of contra-tabulation‚ like the near relation’s ground
of querela, was a material wrong; whereas preterition of liberi was
treated rather aa an informality.

The rights of the patron against the lreedman’s estate were not
only interesting to the ireeborn Roman in his possible character of
a patron, but also in respect oi the manumission of children: lor an
emancipating parent (parens manumissor) had the same claims
against the estate left by the emancipated child as the manumitter
of a slave had against the estate left by the freedman, i.e. a claim
originally to a moiety and subsequently to a third oi the succession,
either contra-tabular or ab intestato. He, however, could not bring
actio Fabiana or Calvisiana to defeat dolose alienatione made in the
lifetime of the emancipated child.

In later times the multiplicatiori of legally protected Peculia,
castrense, quasi-castrense, dac, made emancipation very much less
a matter oi loss to the emancipating parent, and proportionally
deprived oi its strength his claim to the successiones his child.
Hence we find that Novella 115, which recast the rules relating
to inofficiositas, and Novella 118, which reformed intestata law,
