Savigny, fortan thousand read five thousand sesterces in the text

original amount

In the formulary system an appearance of the defendant before
the praetor (in jure) was indispensable aethe first stage of an action.
ln English law, after service of summons or proof that all proper
means for the service of summons have been used in vain, the court
will grant leave to the plaintiff to enter substituted service for the
defendant. But in Roman law an original appearance of the defen·
dant was necessary. On service of a summons (injus vocatio) he
was bound either to obey at once and accompany the plaintiff into
court, or to send a responsible representative (vindex, § 46) in his
stead, or to find security, called cautio judicio sisti (to be thus
interpreted: cautio sisti in jure ad judicium ordinandum), ior his
appearance injure on a future day. If he toolr none of these steps
he was liable tc an actio in factum, and he might be apprehended
and taken by force (duci in jus, Dig. 2, 8, 5, 1); and any person who
made a violent rescue was liable tc be condemned by actio in factum
to pay the amount of the plaintiff’s claim, quanti ea res est ab actore
aestimta, Dig. 2, 7, 5, l. At the first appearance in court, after the
plaintiff had stated vvhich of the actions set out in the album he pro·
posed to bring, or had shown cause why a new action not contained
in the album should be granted to him (editio actionis), the defendant
was required to give security (vadimonium) for his second appearance
in court to receive a judex. At the second appearance, after the
nomination (addictio) of the judex and the joinder in issue or delivery
of the formula (litis contestatio, judicium ordinatum, judicium ac·
ceptum), there was (at all events in the legis actiones) an adjournment
to the next day but one (comperendinatio), and on this day the trial
before the judex (judicium) proceeded. In the formulary system, then,
there were two appearances in jure, one in obedience to the injus
vocatio, and a second for the assignment of a judex. In the Libellary
system which prevailed in the time of J ustinian the former of these
appearances was suppressed, and instead thereof the plaintiff by a
libellus conventionis sued out from the court a commonitio or
summons to the defendant to appear before the court. On the service
cf this by a public cfficer the defendant was required to give cautio
judicio sisti, security for his appearance for the arrangement ola
judicium, and in default thercof was arrested, ξ 184, comm.

§47- The formula says Ejus [aestimationem] condemnato, not
Id condemnato, because the condemnatio did not impose specifio
performance but only pecuniary compensation. Bethmann-Hollweg,
§82 The lawyer's manual of practice contained alternative formulae
for the same ground of action. Sed tamen non parcam operae, et ut
