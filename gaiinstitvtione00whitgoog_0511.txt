a slave or any other certain thing, end then is called condictio

condictio then, strictly speaking, denotes the certainty and indivi-
duality of the property claimed apert from the ground on account oi
which it was claimed. But in later Roman law a condictio incerti,
corresponding to an actio er stipulatu for something unasoertained
in amount, is spoken of, perhaps with en intentio, quidquid paret dare
facere oportere. cf. Sohm, l. ας Lenel, t 57.

’ In condictio certae pecuniae both the intentio (which names certa
pecunie) and the condemnatio are certae. In condictio triticaria the
intentio (which names some other certa res) is certa3 the con·
damnatio (quanti ea res erit) is incerte. In condictio incerti both
intentio and condemnatio are incertae, ξ 49, comm.

§ 6. Rights may be divided into primary and secondary. Primary
rights are antecedent to wrong, such as ownership. Secondary or
sanctioning rights imply an antecedent wrong, and their title isa
breaoh of some primary right, as a brcach of contract or a delict

Both those classes of rights and the corresponding duties are
creatione oi the law: for every law is both imperative and coeroive; -
that is, both by its command confers a primary right and impoees a
corresponding primary duty, and sanctione its command by conferring
a secondary right and imposing a secondary duty, thetis, by confer
ring a remedy and employing coercion in the event ol disobedience.

The sanctione of the civil law are either reparativo and remediat
or punitory end preventive ; and in one case the objectos the law is
the snsronnrros of the plaintiff by restitution or compensation, and
then his primary right is the measure of his redress or sanctioning
right3 in the other ease it is the repression of similar wrongs by
inflicting a rusrsnrrnrr on the defendant which may operate as a
terror to himself in future (reformatory) and to other wrongdoers
(exemplary); and then the sanctioning right may far exeeed his
primary right Even ansromrros may embrace the mediate as well
as the immediate velue of the primary right, 3 t 212, comm.

'I'he language ol Roman jurisprudence makes no distinction bs-
tween a primary right and a sanctioning right when the sanction is
purely asssosarrvn, even though it include indirect or consequential
damages, calling both by the name of the Object (Res). 'Phe redress
directly given by the Roman law under the formulary procedure
was always pecuniary dameges and we might have expected Roman
jurists above all others to distinguish between the objeots of the
plaintiffs primary and secondary right; but the indirect result oi
areal action might be the recovery oi specific restitution, and it was in
