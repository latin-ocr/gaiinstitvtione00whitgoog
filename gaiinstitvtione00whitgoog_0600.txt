thus defined, when once issue was joined iu them, produced what is
¹called a necessary novation, ³ ξ 180. Tollitur adhuc obligatio litis
contestatione, simodo legitimo judicio fuerit actum: nam tune
obligatio quidem principalis dissolvitur, incipit autem teneri reus litis
contestatione. But thie formal rule was not in terpreted as applicable
to actione in factum, since such actions do not allega in the intentio
of their formula any legal claim of the plaiutiff, but only a fact, and
thus do not formally contain any obligation, which could be the
subject of novation 3 actione in factum indeed were used precisely in
those ceses, where no right was recognized by the civil law, that is
where no right would have been enforceable by statute-process Nor
was the principle of ipso jure consumption applicable to real actions
(actiones in rem), as the assertion ma'ds in the intentio of such actions,
eg. hunc fundum ex jure Quiritium meum esse, was not made ex·
clusively againsta particular defendant, and therefore did not prevent
the action being ipso jure maintainable a second time In Beal
actione and actious in iactum, therefore, even though in other respecta
they hed the characteristico of judicialegitima, the defendant required
the protectior oi the exceptio rei in judicium deductae or rei judicatae

ξ 109. The nature of the lex Ollinia ie not known

The earne imperium mixtum whence emanated new actions in
favour of the plaintiff also iesued exceptione in favour of the de·
landant, and in particularthe exceptio rei in judicium deductae or
rei judicatae, which supplemented the novation or consumption
whereby a right oi action was extinguished or annihilated by direct
operation oi law (ipso jure, ξ 106). The aim oi the law in han-ing
onceueed rights oi aetion directly by consumption or indirectly
by exceptio, was to protect a defendant from being haraeeed by
successive suite, and to guard against the public evil which would
arise in the shaps of a general uneettlement and uncertainty of
rights if judicial decisione were not conclusive, Dig 44, 2, 6. ‘ That
one right of action should only be tried once ie a reasonable rule to
prevent interminable litigation and the embarrassment of contrary
decisione.‘' Accordingly, it was adopted as a maxim that (in the
absence oi appeal or aiter appeal) judicial decisione should be assumed
to be true. Res judicata pro veritate accipitur, Dig. l, 5, 25. The
principle may be stated more at length as follows: A judgment
shall not be contradicted by a judgment in a subsequent trial
between the earne parties where the same right ie iu question
(except, of course, by the judgment of a court of appeal). Et gene-
raliter, ut Julianus definit, exceptio rei judicatae obstat quotiens inter
easdem personas eadem quaestio revocatur vel alio genere judicii,
Dig. 44, 2, 7, 4. ‘The plea of previous judgment is a bar when·
