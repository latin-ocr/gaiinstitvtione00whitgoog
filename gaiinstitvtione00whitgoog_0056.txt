l HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION

§lh ric work of uc Jcmacocacta under tte Principale.

The official organa which made Roman law were now, as under
the Republic, assisted by the unofficial or semi-official activity of the
jurisconsults. Some of these teachers were now given public recog·
nition aa authoritative sources of law. We are told that Augustus
granted the right to certain jurisconsults to respond under imperial
authority; and this practice was continued by his successore on the
throne. Amongst the earlier of these patented jurisconsults was
Masurius Sabinus, of the time of the Emperor Tiberius ¹. The
granting of this privilege did not diminish the activity oi the
' unpatented lawyers ², although it doubtless diminished their in·
fluence; but it gave the response of its possessor as authoritative
a character as though it had prooeeded from the emperor himsew.
The response was usually elicited bya party to the suit and presented
to the J udex ⁴. He was bound by the decision⁵; but naturally only
on the assumption that the facts as stated in the petition which
elicited the Rescript were the facts as exhibited in the course of the
trial ⁸. It may have been understood that the opinion of only one
patented counsellor was tp be sought in any single case; for in the
early Principate there seems to have been no provision determining
the conduct ofa Judex when the opinions of his advisere differed.
Later it must have been possible tc elicit the opinion ol several
patented jurists on a single issue; for the Emperor Hadrian framed
the rule that, in the case of conflicting responses, a J udex should be
entitled to use his own discretiori ⁷.

§la Literccy aoticity in ite macic os Lacu to tte
time of Gaius.

The literary activity in the domain of law, during the period
which intervencd between the accession cf Augustus and the time
of Gaius, was of the most varied character⁸. Religioua law (Jus

¹ Pomponius in the Digest (1. 2. 48-50) says ‘Massurius Sabinus (of the tima
oi Tiberius) in equestri ordinefuit et publice primus respondit’3 but he also adda z
‘Primus divus Augustus, ut majorjuris auotoritas haberetur, constituit, ut ex
auctoritate ejus responderent? To make the statements square with one
another, Mommsen would atrike out the words ‘luit et' in the first paragraph,
as being the addition of an interpolator. The statement would then be that
Sabinus was the first patented jurisconsult of equestrian rank.

² This seems shown by the story told by Pomponius in Dig. 1. 2. 2. 49.

⁸ Yet the response was not regarded as a delegation of the power ol the
l'rinceps to issue Rescripta. It may, however, have formed the model for the
