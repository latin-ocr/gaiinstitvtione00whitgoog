Itis necessary to distinguish clearly between the completion of
a contract of sale and the subsequent transfer of ownership; between
the creation of e jus in personam and the eonveyanes of c jus in
rem; between the acquisition of an obligatior and the acquisition of
ownership.

'Phe contract is complete and so binding as soon as the object of
sale and the price are agreed upon, but no property pasees until the
price is paid and the thing is either mancipated or possession is
delivered, or, in the case of asale on credit, until possession is
delivered, Dig. 18, 1, 19. ‘Sale and delivery do not pass property
unless the price is paid, er securityis given for the price, or credit
is given without security,'1nst. 2, 1, 41. ‘Sale and delivery do
not puss property, unless the vendes pays the price, or gives the
vendor security; for instance, by a guarentor discharging the
vendes, or by mortgcge. 1f, however, the sale is on credit, owner·
ship immediately pusses’ '

By English law, if the contractis for the unconditional sala of
srncrrrc goede, ready lor delivery, and the price is ascertuined, the
property in the goods passes to the buysr st the moment that the
contractis complete. But, unless it isa sale on credit, the buyer
cannot demand delivery of the goods until he has psid or tendered
the price. For ifthe sale is for ready money, delivery or tendcr of the
whole of the goede and price are concurrent conditione (i e. the seller

 

the preceding offer determines .
