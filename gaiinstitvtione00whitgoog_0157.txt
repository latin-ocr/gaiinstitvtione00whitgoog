(11, 11 cum incensus aliquis venierit; cf. (lic. Pro (laec. 34, 99).
'l'be lex, the name of which is now illegible, may possibly be the
lex Aelia Sentis, which by one of its provisions reculled into slavery
dediticii, who resided in Rome or within a certain distance from it
(ξ 27), though there is the difficulty that it would be inaccurate to
speak of such freedmen suffering loss of citizenship as well as
liberty. Other grounds of reducing to slavery existed at various
times, as surrender by the pater patratus to a foreign state for an
offenee against intemational law, Livy, 5, 36, οι· evasion of military
service (populus quum eum vendidit qui miles faetus non est, Cic
Pro Osee 34, 11; Ulp. 11, 11), or capture by the enemy, ξ 129, οι
condemnation for a capital crime, which made the convicta slave
01 punishment (servus poenae, Inst 1, 16, 1), ie. reduced him to
penal servitude, or condemnationi of a freedman for ingratitudo
towards bis patron (libertus ingratus circa patronum condemnatus,
ibid) whereupon he forfeited his freedom, or eollusion of a freeman
Ἴ 10 eonsenting to be sold as a slave on condition of sharing the
pumhesemoney (oum liber bomo, major viginti annis, ad pretium
participandum sese venundari passus est, Inst 1, 3, 4). After the
price had been paid, the vendor disappeared, the supposed slave
recovered bis liberty by a liberalis causa, and the purchaser was left
without his slave and without his money. The praetor, to oheck
ibis fraud, allowed the pumhaser to defend himself by exceptio doli,
and senatusconsulta subsequently enaoted, that if the person sold
vas twenty years old at the time of the sale οι· partition of the
price, he should really become tbe slave of the purchaser, Dig.

'l'he libertus ingratus would exemplify a fall from the condition
of libertinus to that of servus; any of the other instances might be
a case of a fall from ingenuus to servus; the fall from ingenuus to
libertinus would also be an analogous kind of degradation. 'I'bus by
the Sc. Claudianum a freewoman (ingenua) who had commerce with
ᾗ sslave with the consent of his proprietor procreated slaves without
i forfeiting her own freedom, § 843 she lost status, however, for she
hemme the freedwoman oi the proprietor, Paulus, 4, 10, ²3 Tac.

civis, latinus, peregrinus, so there are three possible degradatione,
