ln the interdicte Uti possidetis and Utrubi, each party being origin·
ally both plaintiff and defendant, there were (A) two sponsiones and
two restipulationes for a penal aum, on which stipulatione the
principa issue was founded: there was no security (B) eractly corre·
sponding to the Pro praede litis et vindiciarum, but the highest bidler
at the h'uotus licitatio must either enter into a fructuaria stipulatio,
§ lo, which in the event of his failing in the action he must forfeit,
besides having hythe judicium Cascellianum or Secutorium, or action
for giving effect to the main decisiom'to hand over the possession and
meane profits to the successful party ; or as an alternative, if he

t 102. The husband sued for the dower of his divorced wife might
retain a portion on various grounds, of which Immorality was one,
Ulpian, lhugm„ 6, 9, 11. ‘Retentiona in the restitution of dower
are on account of children, immorality, expenditure, donation,
articles purloinod by the wife. On account of children, if the fault
of the wife, or the father in whose power she is, occasioned the
divorce. Thon a sixth is retained on account of each child, but not
more than three sixths altogether. Fer grosa immorality a sixth is
retained, for slight immorality an eighth. Only adultery is gross
immorality.' (Oi t 44, comm.)

Besides the forfaiture of vadimonium, fraudulent absconding
to avoid the summoue ιο appear was an act of bankruptcy, or
motivo for missio iu possessionem. Praetor ait: Qui fraudationis
causa latitabit, siboni viri arbitratu non defendetur, ejus bona pos
sideri vendique jubebo,- Dig. 42, 4, ⁷, l. ‘If a debtor haudulently
abscond, and no sufficient representative defends him, Ι will order
hie goods ιο be possessed and sold!

A heres might, on cause shown to the praetor, immediately after
his entry on the succession, be required by the creditore to give
security for the payment of their claime, with the alternative of
seizure and sale, though only on the ground of his being unlikely to

necessary to prove not only poverty, but fraudulent behaviour on
the part of the heres, Dig. 42, 5, 31.
