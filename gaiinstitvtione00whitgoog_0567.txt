the object 01 inheritanoe is situated whioh the heir ie claiming (forum
rei Sitne).

Distinet from the question 01 the Forum that has jurisdiction
over a right or obligation is the question 01 11ιο Iaw that defines
auch right or obligation: what looal, municipal, or national Law
governs the relation of the plaintiff and defendant, and has to be Ι
administered by the Forum, whatever and whersver it may be, that
exerciees jurisdiction.

'l'he question 01 the Forum before which a suit must be instituted
and 01 the particular Law which such Forum must administer may
ariae (ι) within the limite 010 single state when divided‚ lilre the
Romsm empire, into municipalitiee with separate jurisdictione and,
to 'a certain extent, separate lawe: or (a) in more or less inti·
mate unione 01 cantone, or states, euch ae we see in Switaerlund‚
Germany, Amerioa3 or (3) between different eovereign states.

'Phe territorial local, or municipal law that governs a particular
question may be determined by various circumstances such as the
domicil or the nationality (as in some modern codes) 01 a person
(testator, intestata, insolvent, husband, disponer, debtor, &alr the
place where the object 01 property ie situated: the place 01 per·
iormance 01 an aot pust or brture (disposition, stipulatcd eervicelt
or the place where the formalities of an aot were transacted.

sells to another Frenchman hie goede in Germany. The property
only pasees by tradition. A German in Germany selle 10 another
German his goods in Franco. The property passes by the mere
eontract 01 sale.

In a question 01 contraot the law to be applied generally depende
on ths intention 01 the parties as shown by their agreement; thus the
law which 10 intended is often presumed to be that 01 the place 01
performance.

The Roman doctrine that Inheritanoe 10 a Univereal suecession
impliee that the ideal patrimony has ite single seat in the nationality
or domioil 01 the heritageleaver and is governed by the law 01 that
nationality or dominil. 'Phue the law which governs Succession is
not, alter the analogy 01 the former cases, the law 01 the special
forum of Succeseion: for whereas the law which governs Succession
10 the law 01 the heritageleaver's nationality or last Domioil, we
