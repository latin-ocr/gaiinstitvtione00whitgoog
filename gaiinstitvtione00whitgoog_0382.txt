geritur, id quod neoti dicitur, quo in genere sunt haec, testamenti
factio, nexi datio, nexi liberatio, Festus,

The nexi liberatio seems to be referred to by Gaius, ξ 173. Est
autem alia species imaginariae solutionis per aas et libram. Quod
et ipsum genus certis in causis receptum est3 veluti si quid eo
nomine debeat quod parasset libram gestum sit sive quidex
judicati causa debeat. Nexum and mancipium are clearly dis·
tinguished in the following well-known citation of Festus from the
Twelve Tables-cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncu·
passit, ita jus esto.

From these and other passages we may gat ther that Nexum in
aspecifio sense was, according to the law of the Twelve Tables, a
form oi obligation entered into per aes e tlibram

As a form giving ries to an obligat' ron Nexum was apparently a
eontraot for a money loan (certa pecunia oredita); not a fictitious
money loon, as has sometimes been supposed, but a real one, just as
mancipium was originally not a fictitious, but a real sala Debtors
who bound themselves to their creditore in this solemn way were
the nexi, whose harah treatment in early times is dwelt on by Livy 3
if they made default on the day of payment, they were immediately
treated as judgment debtors, being without further process liable to
manus injectio; ie. to be seized hythe creditor and taken into
' court in order that the praetor might award personal execution3
in other words, deliver him as a quaeislave to the creditor (addicere,
duci jubere).

Nexum as a solemn form of contracting a loan was abolished,
or at least deprived oi its sanction, by the lex Poetelia, Livy, 8, 28:
ae a form of extinction of obligatior in certain cases, Nexum con·
tinued to exist in the time of Gaius, δ 173. ,

In the Twelve Tables the law of contractis still iu a rudimentary
stage. The formal obligation of Nexum is confined to money loans.
Stipulation belongs to later law. No informal contract is recog·
niaed. Suoh contracta, as deposit, loan for use and pledge, could
only be made, itai all, by the tortuous process of mancipatio
cum fiducia

The arrangement adopted by Gaius is not without significanoe.
He begins with a Real, that is, a Formlees contraot, found in jus
gentium and from these Real contracte hs selecta Mutuum, the
contraot which took the place oi the old formal contraot of Nexum,
the source of Roman contraot law. He then proceeds to Formal
contracte, Verbal and Literal, which appear to have been subse·
quent to tho Twelve Tables; and concludes with the remaining
and comparatively modern class of Formless eontracta, namely the
Consensuat ,
