ξ 203. When a sale is complete, property does not, by Roman law,
pass 4ο 4144 vendes before delivery, although the thing sold is forth-
with 444144 4141 41 4144 4444144. If it is stolen before delivery, in
spite 41 4144 rule that the actiones 414414 14 44414441441414 by the person
interested, the vendee cannot sue in his own name, but the vendor is
compellable to cede his actions and the vendes sues in the name 41
4144 4444144, Dig. 47, 2, 14, 1. But 4 person who is neither owner, nor
has any real right in the thing may, as we have seen, have sufficient
interest to enable him to maintain actio furti, though a person could
not under these circumstances make use of the condictio furtiva.

The quadrupla and double darnages for furtum manifestum and
nec manifestum were purely panai The owner could further recover
the thing stolen bys real action (vindicatio), maintainable against
any one in possession 41 4144 stolen property, or damages in a personal
action (condictio furtiva), Inst. 4, 1, 20. The granting of a personsl
action in 41414 case, with an intentio declaring 41444 4144 414141 was
bound 4ο convey the property (dare oportere), was anomalous, because
the property 41 4144 thing stolen was not in the thief but in the
owner, and so could not be conveyed to the latter, 4 § 4.

If 4144 thing stolen had been destroyed, or if, being money, it had
been spent or mixed with money of the thief, the property 41 4144
plaintiff would 14444 14444 14 fact extinguished and condictio would
be a suitable action. If the property existed in the hands 41 4144
414141 44 444141 144 4444441, vindicatio would be maintainable. The
object 41 1144 law in allowing the plaintiff in any casato sue 1444444-
dictio was to relieve him from the necessity 41 ascertaining whether
his property was safe or had been consumed. 11 we ask why, instead
of using the intentio, Si paret dare oportere, 4 ξ 4, which might be
inconsistent with the truth, 4144 pleintiff did not use the formula,
Quidquid paret dare facere oportere, which, as including compensa·
tion or simple restitution 41 possession, would always 144 4444144444
441414 truth ; the answer is probably what Savigny 1444 suggested,
namely, the intention 41 4144 legislator to subject 4144 defendant to the
sponsio poenalis, the additional forfeiturs 414 third 41 4144 sum in
litigation It is 4444 41444 41414 14 only mentioned as incidental to
a condictio for pecunia certa credita, 4 5 171, 1444 4144 penalty may
have also been recoverable in a claim for certain money stolen
(condictio furtiva).

According to hanel, p. 263, 4144 following would be the kind 41
formula 144 4144 actio furti nec manifesti:

Si paret Aulo Agerio a Numerio Negidio, opsve consilio Numerii
Negidii, furtum factum esse paterae aureas;
