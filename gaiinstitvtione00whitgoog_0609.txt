neated. Savfgny, ᾗ 278. Aooordingly ditation, awarded by the
jndge fn response ιο the libellus of the plaintiff and sarred upon
the defendant (insinuatio, conventio) by a publio offioer, was deemed
to be the moment at whieh an aetion oommenees, and prescription
is interrupted, or usuoapion is revocable. Interruptio per oon·
tentionem introducta, God. 7, 39, 7, ὅ. Qui obnoxium auum in

videri jus auum omne eum in judicium deduxisse et esse interrupta

The opinion of Savigny that prescription in later Roman law was
interrupted οι· put a stop ιο in all aetions elika by (litationis the
generally reeeived one, though Vaugerow and others maintein that
thia only applies to actiones perpetuae, not ιο artiones temporales,
the old rule ae ιο litis oontsstatio still surviving aeaording to them
in reapeet of the latter. Sevigny refuses to aooept sueh limitation,
and explains (ι 242, ΙΙΙ) how this erroneous view (aa he oonsiders
it) arose 'Phe passages from the older writers mentioning litis
oentestatio in this eonnexion all refer ιο actiones temporales for
the simple reason that none other were prescriptible in the elaesioal
law, but it does not follow that this differente between the two kinds
of aetion was maintained, when allectione booanm preseriptible;
indeed, if there was to be any differenee, the interruption of actiones
temporales ought ιο have been made eesier than that of actiones
perpetuae, and not, as aooording ιο Vangerow's view ιι would be,
more diffieult The two passages in the Digest whieh seem ιο
support Vangerow, Dig. 12, 2, 9, ³, Dig. 27, 7, 8, 1, the eompilers
forgot to alter, so es ιο bring them into aoeordanoe with existing
law. (Windsoheid, 1 5 108, n. 4.)

We must distinguish between the interruption and the mere
suspension, dormaney, or stay, of prescription. When prescription
is interrupted (for instanoe, by aohnowledgment of the debt) the
already elapsed period of inaotivity onthe pert of the plaintiffis
oenoelled, and the whole presoription must raoommenoe from the
date of the interruption. When prescription is suspended, if suth
strepension takes plaoe after prescription hes begun ιο ιιι, the
period which has elapsed is not invalidated but is added ιο the
period which follows the removal of the obateole whioh oaused the
suspensior. suspension, ae expressed in the modern maxim: Agere
non valenti non aurrit praescriptio, is produeed by some inability oi
the pleintiff ιο sue: but thia rule is not generally applioable, when
the aetion ean be carried on by en agent, es in the ease of a lunatio ;
though suspension is produaed by the party entitled being impubes
