The praetorian succession, or right 01 succession introduced by the
praetor under the name 01 Bonorum possessio, sometimes as supple·
mentary 10, and sometimes in the place of, civilis hereditas, may be
divided into testate succession and intestate succession. The latter
branch (bonorum possessio intestati) was finnly established at an
earlier period than 1110 former (bonorum possessio secundum tabulas).
The rescript mentioned by Gaius, ξ 120, which is attributed by some
writers to Antoninus Pius and by others 1ο Marcus Aurelius, as is the
more probable view, may bc regarded as having definitively estab-
lished the validity 01 the praetorian testament, not simply when
supplementary to, but also when in opposition to, jus civile ; in other
words, a practorian will might make a person bonorum possessor
cum re, although 1110 inheritance was claimed by some one with a
valid civil 11110.

In its origin Bonorum possessio was probably only the provisional or
interimistic possession granted to one of the parties ina suit 01 Heredi-
tatis petitio, cf. Sohm, ξ 110. This suit was a species 01 Real action
(actio in rem), and in all Real actions itis necessary 1ο determine which
01 the litigante shall 11110 possession during the pendency of the litiga·
tion. In the earliest period, that 01 statute-process (legis actio), the
interim possession was called vindiciae, and the praetor who assigned
it to one 01 1110 parties was said vindicias dicere, 4§ 16. In making the
grant 01 vindiciae 110 was probably governed by the same 11110 which
afterwards prevailed when the question 01 1111011111 possession was
determined by application 011110 Interdicts Utrubi and Uti possidetis:
that is to say he probably allowed the party in actual possession 10
continue in possession. But this rule was inapplicable 10 1110 case
01 Hereditatis petitio, forat 1110 (1000110 01 1110 proprietor who leaves
an inhen'tance not 0110 01 the claimants to suoceed may bc in actual
possession. Here accordingly the grant was governed by different
principles: 11 1 will, prima facie 111111, was propounded, possession
was granted 10 the claimant under the will (bonorum possessio
secundum tabulasl: if no such will was propounded, possession was
granted 10 1110 civil heirs, the seli-successor (suus heres] being eventu·
ally allowed to claim bonorum possessio unde liberi, coming before 1110
nearest agnates (legitimi). Then as supplementary to 1110 civil law,
persons who were not recognized as heredes, namcly persons claiming
under a praetorian will, till they were preferred by statute to agnates,
§ 120, and next cognatas (bonorum possessio unde cognati), and the
wife or husband, as such (bonorum possessio unde vir 01 11101), were
put in possession in default 01 other heirs: children (liberi), who by
emancipation had lost the character 01 seli-successors, were never·
theless admitted 10 possession in the first order in preference tc agnates
01 1110 second order, just as 11 they had continued unemancipated
