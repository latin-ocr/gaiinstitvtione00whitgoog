is cn evident Tribonianism for mancipatos. But this law was after·
wards evaded by juristic ingenuity‚ the practice ot peying only a
nominal sum—a single sesterce-being held to be a sufficient com·
pliance with it. This made it possible to use mancipation as a mere
conveyancing form. Even in the case of genuine sales, it was found
adventageous only thus to pay a nominal sum in the mancipation
itsell end to make the payment of the purchase money something
entirely apert, for by this means the mancipating party in fact escaped
the liability imposed on him hythe Twelve Tables of paying, aa

· warrantor of the title (auctor), double the price ιο the other party ιο

the transaction in case of the latter being evicted (cf. cie pro Mur.
2, 3, in (laec 19, 54), and it had the further advantage that the pur·
chaser wes enabled ιο acquire ownership by the mancipation before he
had paid the actual purchase money (cf. hluirhead, Roman Law, §30 3
Sohm, pp. 51,61t How, by meansof the nuncupation end bycollateral
fiducisry agreements, mancipation was adapted ιο effect various legal
purposes‚ may be seen in other parts ol the text and commentary.

rPhe form of mancipation (1, 119) shows its archaic origin. Ii, as
has been thought by many modern writers, the witnesses ιο it
originally represented the five classes of the Roman people, manci·
pstiom at least in its ultimate form, cannot have been earlier than
the Servian constitution, by which this division of the people was
made. The advantage ol requiring the presence of a number of
citizens to bear testimony ιο important transfers ol property in an
age when writing was notin common use is apparent.

§pas-26. In jure cessio-the other mode of transfer peculiar to
J us Civile, and so likewise confined to Roman citizens, is an adapta·
tion of the legis actio per vindicationem ιο conveyancing purposes
depending tor its operation on the collusive admission by the
defendant of the supposed plnintiff’s claim (confessus prejudicato
eat). This fictitious process, which is not so primitive in character
as mancipation, though it was also recognized by the law oi the
Twelve Tables, must have been introduced to circumvent the law
in order to effect objects unattainable by direct means, such as the
manumission of slaves. Though Quiritary ownership could be·thus
conveyed, it was, for the reason given in ξ 25, ramly employed ior
this purpose. But for creating or transferring some kinds of rights
surrendsr before a magistrate was essential, ιι 30, 34.

In jure cessio or surrender before a magistrats cannot fail to
reoall to an English lawyer two similar modes of alienation that
recently existed in English jurisprudence, alienation by Fine and
alienation by Reoovery, both of which, like in jure cessio, were
based on a fictitious ection; in both of which, that is to say,
although the parties did not really stand in the relation ol adverse
