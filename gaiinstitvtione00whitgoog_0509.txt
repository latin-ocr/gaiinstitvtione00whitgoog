Π. §t 1-9.] ACTIONVM DIVISIO 449

Similarly a right of prohibiting a neighbour from raising the
height of his house would probably be asserted by actio confessoris
of jus Non altius tollendi if the defendant denied that such aright
had ever existed: by actio Negatoria of jus altius tollendi, eon·
sistently with Inst. 4, 6, 2 (contra quoque de usufructu et de
servitutibus praediorum rusticorum, item praediorum urbanorum
invicem quoque proditae sunt actiones, ut quis intendat jus non
esse adversario. . ,altius tollendi. . . 3 istae quoque actiones iu rem
sunt, sed Negativae. Quod genus actionis in controversiis rerum
corporalium proditum non est; namin his is agit qui non possidet:
ei vero qui possidet non est actio prodita, perquam neget rem
actoris esse), iithe defendant contended that, though lt once existed,
it had been extinguished by usucapio libertatis

Whether an action was Confesscria or Negatoria might possibly
¹depend on the fofm in which the owner asserted the freedom of his

,1 property from any claim on the part of another to interfere with it
For instance, in Dig. 8, 5, 4, 7, where Ulpian is apparently speaking
of actio Negativa of jus Non altius tollendi, he presently adds: hoc
igitur intendo, habere me jus altius tollendi invito eo cum quo ago:
terme which seem more appropriate for expmseing an actio Ocn-
feaeoria of a jus altius tollendi ς and which probably would express
such an action, if the plaintiff intended to aver a reacquisitiou of his
original freedom.

In both confessoris and Negatoria the first proof was, according
to the ordinary rufe, incumbent on the plaintiff. 'Phe plaintiff
Negatcr of jus Non altius tollendi or Assertor of jus altius tollendi
hed first to adduce proof in support of hia contention-which in the
former case would be simply to prove the fact of his ownership-
before the defendant was called upon to prove his opposite contentiou:
and the plaintiff, as asserting a right of servitude, must begin with
adducing proof of its existence before the defendant is called upon
to disprove its existence or to prove its extinction. of. ξ 88, comm.

The abolition in England of real actions has destroyed most of
the likeness that once existed in the remedies provided by English
law for the protection or impeachment of Profits and Eaeements
(more or less identioal with the rights which the Romans called
Servitudes) and the remedies by which at Roman law Servitudes
were protected or impeached. Before the abolition of Real actione
each incorporeal hereditament was asserted or contested by some
Beal action corresponding either to actio confessario or to actio
Negatoria. After their abolition the only remedy is 'Prespass or
Trespass on the case (or their modern equivalents)‚ personal actions
which procuro not restitution of a real right, but satisfaction in
damages for injury sustsined by its contraventiou, and which will lie
