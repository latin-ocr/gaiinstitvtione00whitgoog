testatio denoted the commencement of the trial before the judex.
Lis enirn tunc contestata videtur, quum judex per narrationem
negotii caueam audire coeperit, eod. 3, 9, l. ‘Litis contestatio ie
the moment when the judge begins to hear the recital of the cause
of action! By legitima judicia, 4 ξ 103, Gaius denotes those actions
in the formulary procedure which by provision of the lex Aebutia,
whereby statute-process was abolished, were put on the same footing
aa the legis actiones and so had the same effect, in respect of nova-
tion and otherwise, as this statuteprocess, which they superseded‚
cf. Sohm, pp. 260, 267. Actione terminable with the praetorship
were such actions as did not derivo their validity irom the lex
Aebutia, but simply from the executive power of the praetor (quae
imperio continentia, ξ 101, cf. 4 ξ 105).

The transformatione of Litis contestatio which are described above
were not the last that it was destined to undergo. In the first stage
of procedure under the Canon law, aiter the libellus of the plaintiff
had been read aloud, the judge aelred the plaintiff whether he abided
by his suit ; and, on hie answer in the affirmative, his libellus was
contradicted by the defendant in general terme (nego narrata prout
narrantur et dico petita fieri non debere). The detailed contentiori
of the parties over the particular averments of the plaintiff did not
follow tilla subsequent stage

In Germany in an. 1654 an ordinance oi the empire required
the defendant to anewer all the allegatione of the plaintifi' and
adduce all his own exceptione at the first stage: and, asin practice
the reading of the plaintifi's libellus was omitted, the Litis con·
testatio, or first term or stage oi the suit, consisted in this detailed
answer of the defendant. Subsequently, when written documenta
superseded oral procedure, the Litis contestatio was identified with
the defendant’e delivery oi what was called hie book of exceptione.

The Novation produced by Litis contestatio is called by modern
writers Novatio necessaria It hae not all the incidente of Neratio
voluntaria, or Novation induced by agreement: for instance, as
Litis contestatio must not deteriorata the position of the creditor,
the object oi ite incidente being to remove the disadvantages which
he suffers from the duration of the suit, it does not extinguieh the
accessories of the principal obligation, e. g. interest, fidejussio,
hypotheca, Dig. 46, 2, 29. 12 originally, ae we have seen, in con·
sequence of the Correality of the Fidejussor, ie. the unity of his
obligation with that oi the principal, extinguished the liability of
the Fidejueeor: but this rule, as we have mentioned, was abrogated
by J ustinian, who enacted that the liability of the Fidejuesor could
not be extinguished by Litis contestatio, but only by Solutio.
