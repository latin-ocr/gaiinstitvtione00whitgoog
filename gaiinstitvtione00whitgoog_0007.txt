PREFAOE

Tne deeth of the author of this Commentary end Translation

Ἴ has taken from us one who in the inter-vals allowed him by

' his official dutiee gave himself with single-minded devotion to

the acquisition and furtheranee of knowledge. ‘Omnium quos

cognovi, doctissimus’ were the words in which Mr. Poste's great

emdition was commemorated by the Vise-Chaucellor of the

University, the distinguished head of the distinguished Oollege

ol which Mr. Poste was almost the senior Fellow3 and certainly

no one ean read this Commentary without being impressed

' by the writer's philosophie spirit and extensive learning. It

l is especially remarkable that a scholar, who was never engaged

in the tecching or practice of law, should have produced

a legul textbook, which perhaps more than any other makes

intelligible to English studente the teaohing of the grean German

, masters cf Roman jurisprudence and at the same time never fails
to be interesting by reason of its own force and individuality.

In re-editing this well-known work, at the request of Mr. Poste’s

executore and of the Delegates of the Clarendon Press‚ my

endeavour hae been to preserve ae lar as possible the character

which Mr. Poste himself gave it, while making such alterations

as seemed to be required at the present time. As Mr. Poste

never revised his Translation and Commentary with any com-

pleteneas since they were first published, their revision for this

edition has been a more considerable undertaking than would

otherwise have been the case. It should be noticed that the

part ol the Commentery relating to analytic jurisprudence has

been much curtailed in the present edition. This has been done

hythe advice ol persons engaged in the teaching oi Roman

law at Oxford who are of opinion that the insertion of so much

matter bearing on the general theory of law has rendered the

Commentary unnecessarily difficult to studente and that the

subject is one better leit to independent treatises. The omission

of the Preliminary Definitions on this account hes made it

possible to introduce into the book an Historical Introduction

to Gaius, which has beon written by Dr. Greenidge, who is well
