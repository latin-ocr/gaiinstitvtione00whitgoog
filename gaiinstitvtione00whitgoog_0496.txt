436 , ADDENDUM

a contract of sale, operatas no transfer of ownership except in sales
expressly oa credit until the purchase money is peid or securityis
given for its payment. Thia, ae we have seen, 2 t 65, comm„ was
a provision of the Twelve Tables in respect of Mancipation and in
later times extended to Tradition. Surrender before the magistrate
was not thus restricted in its operation, but transferred ovvnership
irrespcctively of the payment of purchase money. Ihering aleo holds
that in Mancipah'on the requirement of the Twelve Tables was deemed
to be satisfied by the simulation of payment (isque mihi emptus eet
hoc aere aeneaque libral3 aud he suggests that the existence of the
requirement was the very reason why the simulation of payment was
introduced into thie solemnity.

In thie single point, then, Mancipatiou (if Ihering’e view on the
subject is accepted) and Surrender before the magistrate were more
completely isolated from their causa than Tradition: but with thie
exception, Formal and Formless alienatione ware equally assumor.
Both operated a transfer of ownerehip in spite of any flaw in the causa
If euch a flaw existed in either a Formal or a Formlees alienation it
only gave the alienor a personal action (condictio) against the alienes
for restitution. He could not recover the propertyif it had passed
out of the hands of the first alienae into those oia second.

lf we inquire why Formlese alienation was allowed to have validity
irrespectively of the causal factor, we shall find the reason to be, that
Tradition or parting with possession, though a Formless proceeding,
is an act of so serious a character as effectually to preclude all idea of
indecision-to prove that the parties had reached the stage of defini-
tive resolution Accordingly the intention of transferring ownership
when manifested by 'lhadition seems to deservo all the efficacy that
could be imparted by the observance of the most solemn Forma

As in the later jurisprudence stipulatio was robbed of part of its
efficacy by the Exceptio pecuniae non numeratae, so, though at an
earlier period, aud in a different way, Alienatione and other transac·
tione, whether Forma] or Formless‚ could be prevented from operating
by the in integrum Restitutio, and by the actio quod metus causa,
impersonal remedias (in rem) which reached the person benefited by
property to whatever hands it might have arrived by the effect ol
subsequent alienatione.

If, then, Formal alienatione were not simplifications of title in
virtue of any greater ansraacrnnes than was possessed by Formiae
alienation, for what other advantage were they introduced into
commerce? by what other attribute were they a facilitation of Proof?
They facilitated proci ( 1) of the specific intention ofa dispoeer against
an allegetion ofa different intention, and (2) of the existence of
intention against the denial of all intention.
