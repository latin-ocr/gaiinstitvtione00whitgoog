Quod ex justa 00100 corporaliter a servo tenetur, id in peculio servi
est et peculium, quod servus civiliter quidem possidere non posset sed
naturaliter tenet, dominus creditur possidere, Dig. 41, 2, 24. ‘When
001010 has corporeal control 010 thing originating 110111 some legal
cause, the thing is in his peculium, and this peculium which he 00111101
have juristio possession 01, though he holds it in 1001, his master has
possession 01.’ Qui in aliena potestate sunt, rem peculiarem tenere
possunt, habere possidere non possunt, quis possessionen tantum
corporis, sed et juris est, Dig. 41, 2, 49, 1. ‘A person under power
is able to keep under his actual control a thing belonging 10 his
peculium, but not 10 possess it, for the conditione 01 possession 010
not purely physical, but partly lega13’ 10. possession is not mere
physioal detention, but detention by a person who is regarded by
law 00 being capable of possessing. In respect cithia incapacity
01 filiusfamilias we must except the peculium castrense and quasi·
castrense. Filiusfamilias et maxime miles in caetris adquisitum
usucapiet, Dig. 41, 3, 4, 1. ‘What a filiusfamilias and particularly
what 00 0 soldier he acquires in the field is converted by usucapion-
possession into ownership.' ’

Amanageroragent(proourator)hasdetention,notpossession. Nec
idem est possidere 01 0110110 nomine possidere; nam possidet cujus
nomine possidetur; procurator alienae possessioni praestat ministe-
rium, Dig. 41 , 2, 18, pr. ‘Possession differs 110111 detentionin the name

A 1011011101 (00101001101011110) has only detention, the lender (com-
