§220. Injuria in this chapter denotes not any wrongful or un·
lawful aot, but contumelious wrong, wrong tending to degradation,
a violation of the right to respect, honour, reputation ; such as libel,
malicious prosecution, assault and hattery, and the like.

§ 221. If the husband were a filiusfamilias, the offender would be
liable to a fourth action, on the part of the father of the husband.
In each of these actions the damages might be different, being
measured by the varying dignity ol the party dishonoured by tha
outrage, §225. ,

Outrage, like theft and robbery, and unlike damage under the ¹
lex Aquilia, requires dolus malus, or unlawful intent. In outrage,
as in other delicte, the plaintiff had his option of proeeeding civilly
orcriminally,1nst. 4, 4, 10.

Lenel, ξ 190, suggests the following as the formula of the actio
injuriarum. Quod dolo malo Numenii Negidii Aulo Agerio pugno
malo percussa est, qua de re agitur, quantam pecuniam vobis bonum
aequum videbitur ob eam rem Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio
condemnari, dumtaxat HS ..... tantam pecuniam, si non plus
quam annus est, oum de ea re experiundi potestas fuit, recupera·
tores, Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio condemnato: si non paret
absolvito.

In the Roman law which was in force as the common Law of
German jurisprudenco, till recently superseded by the German civil
Gode, simply penal suits appear to have been obsoleta, with the ex-
ception of Iniuriarum (see on this subject Burgerliohes Gosetzbuch
or German civil Gode, § 823, dc.); and hera the modern plaintiff
has his election between pecuniary damages and an apology or
revocation of the injurious utterance. An inquiry into the reason
why the actio injuriarum alone has survived will illustrate tha
nature of simply penal suits. Their prinoipal object, as already
suggested, wasto induce the aggrieved party to abstain lrom the
ramedy offered him in archaic society, sels-redress or private revenga
In the case of other wrongs such inducement is no longer necessary.
But in the case of Affront or Dishonour the effect ol the modern
code of honour has led the modorns even more than the ancients to
prefer the archaic institution oi Feud or private war, as embodied
in the Duel, to an unromantic appeal to the public tribunale Here,
than, the inducement to abstain from seli-help, which elsewhere is
not needed, is still required.

Theo and Rapina are removed in the present day from the Penal
