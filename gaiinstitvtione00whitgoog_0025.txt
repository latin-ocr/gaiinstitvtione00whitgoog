PATRIOIANS AND PLEBElANS xix

dietam sities who were protectcd by the govemment and the
patrician clane. But it seems impossible that causes such as these
could bave led to the creation of a mass of men that appears in early
Roman history as forming the bulk of the community; and it is
2 possible that further evidence (archaeological and ethnological) may
show that the distinction between Patricians aud Plebeians is one
, hesed on racc, and that the existence oi the Patricians as a governing
¹ class is the result of the conquest ofa native race by bande of im·
¹ migrant wanderers ¹. Throughout Roman law there is a curicus
¹ persistenoe of dual forms for the attainment of the same end which
may be a survival of two distinct eystems of customary law possessed
by different pecples, the conquerors and the conquered. Thus we
have the Sponsio side by side with the Nexum, marriage by Gon·
fanestis side by side with marriage by Usus or Goemptio, the
testament in the Comitia Galata side by side with the testament ‘ per
aes et libram.' The procedure ‘by the copper and the scales,’ in
the manifold forms which it assumes, seems to be especially a
characteristic of ‚the popular law of the commone. The exclusion of
the Plebeians from the magistracy and the priestbood, and the denial
to them of the right of conubium with Patricians, may also point
in the direction of a fundamental racial distinction between the two
clames· But the disabilities consequent on this racial distinction,
ifwe suppose it to have existed, were by no means limited to the
domain of public rights They pervaded the whole of Roman life to
auch an extent that there is considerable justification for the view
that the early condition of the Plebeian was very like that of the
client In the first place, the Patricians maintained that they alone
formed Gentes, and the condition of being a member of a Gens, or
Gentilis, was that the man who made the claim should be able to
point to a perfectly free ancestry'. In this claim of the Patricians
we therefore have the implication that the ancestors of the Plebeians
were not free. In all respecta but this, the Plebeians formed Olane
just like the Patricians. A group of Plebeians who bore a common
name formed a Stirpe, but this Stirpe was supposed to be a mere
offshoot of some patrician Gens on which it was held to be de·
pendent. It possessed no independent rights of its own. A group
of Plebeians who could traca their ancestry back to a common

tha two main elementa ln the population of early Rome were the aboriginal
Ligariana who formed the Plebs, and the Umbrian Sabinos, who formed the
