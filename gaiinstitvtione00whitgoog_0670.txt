610 DE ACTIONIBVS [ruptim-170.

Theophilus, the colleague ol 'l'ribonian and author of the Greek
version of J ustinian’s Institutes, says: νέμεσθαί ἐστι τὸ ψυχῇ δεσπόζοντος
κατέχειν, 3, 39, 2. 'Phe meaning ol this delinition will best appear
from an examination of the instances in which according to the jurists
Possession does or does not exist3 and in particular from the oontrast
oi the cases where Possession is present with those where Detention,
i. e. mere physioal control ior another, the right of excluding others
belonging to him, is present but Possession, which is protected hy
possessory interdicts, is absent, as e. g. in the case of depositarius
or commodatarius. Thus Possession in tho sense in which we are
using it is equivalent to juristio Possession.

Possession in this sensa cs opposed to mere Detention, is called
Possessio civilis, or simply Possessio.

Mero detentionis called Possessio naturalis, corporaliter, Natu·
raliter tenere, In possessione esse. (For various meanings of the
terme Possessio civilis—naturalis cf. Windsoheid, Pand. l ξ 148,
n. 12. Dernburg, Pand 15175.) ’

J uristic possession (jus possessionis) does not dspend on a legal
title to possess (jus possidendi) like ownership, but simply on the fact
of a man’s having actual control of a thing with the intentiones
maintaining it. ‘Hujus autem interdicti (uti Possidetis) proponendi
causa haec fuit, quod separata esse debet possessio a proprietate
lieri etenim potest, ut alter possessor sit, dominus non sir, alter
dominus quidem sit, possessor vero non sit; fieri potest, ut st pos·
sessor idem et dominus sit.¹ Dig. 43, 17, l, 2. Hence as far aa the
possessory interdicta are concerned the lewisindifferent whether the
possession is that of an owner or of a bona fide, or even that ofa
mala fide possessor. But it is to be remembered at the same time
that these interdicte do not in any way shut out the owner who has
a right to possession from asserting his claim by vindicatio.

'Phe characteristic of possessio civilisis the combination of physioal
control with the Animus domini: but in certain singular or abnormal
instanoes we shall find that this differentia is wanting, and physical
control or detention in the name of another (alieno nomine), io.
possessio naturalis, is treated as juristic possession, e. g. in the cass
of pledgee or mortgagee.

Possession accompanied with certain other extraneous conditione,
namely Titulus, Bona fides, and the absence of furtum, is trans·
formed by a certain lapse ot time into ownership 3 and is called
Usucapionpossession, 2§§ 40-61, comm. Our present purpose is
with Possession apart from these foreign elementa: the Possesdon
which, as protected by Utrubi, Uti possidetis, and Unde vi, is osten
called Interdictpossession.

The slave and filiusfamilias were incapablc ot juristic possession
