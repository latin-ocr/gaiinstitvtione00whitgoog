3 §172 It willbe obsorved that this rule desistes from the principle
laid down in 5166. A constitution of Marcus Aurelius changing

the law further in the same direction‚ and mentioned by Ulpian

’ (sed postea divus Marcus constituit, utet pro herede gerendo ex
asse fiat heres, 22, 34. ‘subsequently Marcus Aurelius enacted that
acts oi heirship would make him [the person instituted, in the case

of cretio imperfecta] exclusive heir Ἰ, was clearly not enacted when
this paragraph was written by Gaius, and furnishes an indication

² of the date at which this book of his Institutione was published.
¹ Marcus Aurelius was sole emperor an. les-176.

§lis Cicero frequently mentions a great ease in which the

ι question arose whether a vulgaris substitutio may be irnplied from

a pupillaris substitutio. The centumviral court decided that the

intention rather than the words oi the testator should presail, and
¹ that the heir appointed 6ο succeed theson in case the son died

before puberty should be deemed appointed to succeed the testator
in case no son was born: Malim mihi L. Crassi unam pro Μ’. Ourio
dictionem quam castellanos triumphos duos, Brutus 73, ‘I would
rather have made the single speech oi Lucius Crassus for Manius
curius than have had two triumphs for the capture of fortresses'
'rhe other passages are worth referring to De Orat. 1, 39, 57 ; 2, 6, 32 ;
Brutus, 39, 52; Pro Caecina, 18, 533 Topica, 10, 44. Marcus
Aurelius enaeted that in every case pupillaris substitutio should be

t implied in vulgaris substituto and vice versa, unless the contrary

ζ hitention was expressed, Dig. 28, 6, 4.
