the Twelve Tables, on which the· mancipatory will was founded, in·
tended to be used so as to defeat the elsinas of sui heredes (Muirhead,
Roman Low, § 32). These consideratione involve the rules respecting
the effect ei Praeteritio. If the testator's dispositione were valid
in spite of Praeteritio, he would have itin his power to commit
ahnud upon the assembly by suppressing some element that was
material to enable them to form a judgement Accordingly Prae·
teritio was made to defeat itseli, in the case of the sen by nullification
(inutiliter), in the case of other issue by secretio, § 124. However‚
although by the (livil law Praeterition avoided avvill and was not cured
hythe death of Praeteritus before Testator, yet Praetorian law only
regarded the date of Testator’s death, and, ifno Praeteritus was then
asans, counteracted the nullity of the will by Juxta-tabnation.
After the introduction of the mancipatory will the fraud against

the making ofa will, are uncertain persons, and, hythe general rule
that uncertain persons cannot be instituted or disinherited (incerta
persons heres institui non potest, Ulpian 22, 4), ought to be incapable
of institution or disinheritance, and, therefore, if they are sui heredes,
would necessarily invalidate a will, because every will is informal
when there existe a suus heres who is neither instituted nor dis·
