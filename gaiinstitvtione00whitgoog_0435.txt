empirc. Oolonatus, the condition of the latter colonus, is an insti·
tution whose origin is obscure, but which probably began to be
common as early as i. n. 200. Golonatus was nota mere contractual
relation or jus in personam, but a real right or jus iri rem, and may be
regarded as a new form of dependent status, a condition of subjection
to a superior, which may be olassified with the status of familia or
domestic relations. It was a condition niidway between sreedom and
slavery. The colonus was liber and civis, but he was called by the
lawgiver servus terrae. He was inseparably bound to the soil:
a fugitive colonus, like a fugitive slave, was said to commit a theft
of his own body, and he could be recovered by real action (vindi-
catio) from any one who gave him harbour. He had property, but
it was called peculium, and, though he could not be deprived of it
like the slave, yet he could not aliene it without the consent of his
lord. With certain exceptione, he could not maintain an action
against his lord, who was called his patronus. Neithsr a colonus
nor his descendants could diveat themselves of their hereditary
seridom. The colonus, having no Real right in the soil, paid no
land tax, but only a personal or capitation tax, like artisans and
slaves. As havingan inheritad condition, the colonus or inquilinus
was called originarius ; as subject to the capitution tax he was called
tributarius, capite censitus, adscriptitiae, censibus adscriptus. He
paid to his lord a certain annual rent (canon), usually in kind, and
always incapable of augmentation. This fixity of his rent was the
principal right whioh he enjoyed. See Savigny’s Vermischte Schriften,
15. If, secking in Roman law for types of Feudal institutione, we
find the germ of frechold tenure in Emphyteusis, the antitypa of
oopyhold tenure may similarly be discovered in Colonatus.
