111. §tw-96] VERBIS OBLIGATIO 337

authorizing the plaintiff to enter up judgmcnt and issue execution
agnina him, either at once and unconditionally, or on a future day
conditionally on non-payment oi whatever amount moy be agreed
upon; or the party ιο bc bound gives awarrant of attorney, that
is, authority ιο an attorney to confess an action of debt or suffer
judgment to go by default, the warrant being accompanied by a
deleasance declaring it to be merely a security for payment of
a certain sum and interest, and providing that no execution shall
issue unless default in the payment shall have been made.

The conjunction of a penal clause and a condition avoiding it is
common to the judgment debt, recognisance, bond, and stipulatio
poenae nomine. The Roman Nexum, as we have stated, had appa·
rently the effect of a Judgment debt3 being a transaction per aes et
libram it could not itseli be conditional.

ξ 93. Why was Sponsio binding on Romans and not on strangers?
Possibly because originally it was an oath or adjuration oi the.
tutelary gods of Rome, who would not be an object oi reverende ιο
a stranger.

ι 94. 'Phe obligation of an independcnt sovereign state to another
independent sovereign state does not exaotly resemble the obligatior
of one subject to another subject oi the same sovereign or political
superior. Ifa contract between two subjecte is broken, it is enforced
by the power ol the common sovereign. But if a treaty between
two sovereigns is violated, there is, by hypothesis, no common
superior by whom it may be eniorced. The treaties of sovereign
states give rise to moral obligations similar to those of individuals.
They may be binding in the forum of conscience or oi heaven, but,
if these are disrcgarded, are not enforced by any earthly tribunal.
The moral obligation is not secured by any strictly legal sanction ς
and the sovereign whose treaty rights are violated can obtain no
redress except from the force oi internetional opinion and his own
power of inflicting evil on the violator.

Or we may compare the relation oi sovereign states io the relation
oi individuale before the complete estsblishment of political society.
There is then sufficient intercourse to form a publio opinion and
certain conceptions of rIghts and wrongs; but not sufficient organi·
astion ιο dispense with the necessity oi seli-vindication or sslf-
defence. In such a state the redress of the individual for the harms
he suffered was by seud or private avar. Thai such astate once
existed we irnow from the carly history of our ancestors and their

, Teutonic kinsmen. So the redress of sovereigns is war or public

feud. In the controversies oi individuale the system of private war
was abohshed in this country by the proclamation of ‘the king's
peace‚' renewsd at every coronation-—the symbol of the consolidation
