lii HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION

(apparently 0 few months towards the close 01 1110 111100 years
devoted to the compilation 01 1110 Digest, Inst proem) is less
surprising when we see how closely Tribonian has followed the
arrangement 01 Gaius, and how largely, when 00 change of legisla-
tion prohibited, he has appropriated his very words.'

‘certain internal evidences fix the date at which portione 01 1110
Institutione were composed. The Emperor Hadrian is spoken 01

’ as departed or deceased (Divius) except in 1.§ 47 and 2. ξ 57.

Antoninus Pius is sometimes (1. ξ 53, 1. 0102) named without this
epithet, but in 2. ξ 195 11001110 style 01 Divus Marcus Aurelius
was probably named, 2. ξ 126, 0011 1110 Institutione were probably
published before his death, 101 2. ξ 177 contains no notice 01 a
constitution 01 1110, recorded by Ulpian, that bears on the matter ‘-
in question. Paragraphs 3. ξ 24, 25, would hardly have been
penned after the Sc. Orphitianum, 0. 0. 178, 011110 Sc. Tertullianum,
A.n.158.’ 11 1100, however, been held that Gaius when he wrote
the Institutione was acquainted with the Sc. Tertullianum, and that
amention 01 11 occupied a gap in the manuscript which 10 found in
3. 33. See the commentary on this passage.

Tho discovery of the text of the Institutione was ,made in 1816.
In that year ‘Niebuhr noticed in the library of the 0011100101 Chapter
01 Verona a manuscript in which certain compositions 01 Saint
J erome had been written over some prior writings, which in certain
places had themselves been superposed on some still earlier in·
scription. In communication with Savigny, Niebuhr cameto the
conclusion that the lowest or earliest inscription was au elementary
treatise on Roman Law by 00100, streatise hitherto only known, or
principally known, 10 Roman lawyers by a barbarous epitome 01 110
00010010 inserted in the (lodecf Alaric II, King 01 1110 Visigoths
(ξ 1, 22, 0001111). The palimpscst 01 rewritten manuscript originally
contained 129 101100, three 01 which are now lost One 10110 be·
longing to the Fourth Book (§ 136-§ 144), having been detached by
some accident 110111 110 follows, had been published by Maffei in his
Historia Tcoloyr'ca, ,1.0. 1740, and republished by Haubold in the
very year in which Niebuhr discovered the rest of the codex!

ι1100110000 of the MS. generally contains twenty-four lines, each
line thirty-nine letters; but sometimes as many as 10110-1100. 011
sixty peges, or about a fourth 01 1110 whole, the codex is doubly
palimpsest, ie. there are three inscriptions on the parchment About
atenth 01 1110 whole is lost or completely illegible, but part 01 11110
may be restored from ‹Iustinian’s Institutas, 01 11010 011101 0001000;

accordingly, 01 1110 whole Institutione about onethirteenth is wanting,
one half of which belongs to the Fourth Book!

‘From the style of the handwriting the MS. isjudged to be older
