16 make some payment orto convey something 16 him (dare) or 16
release him from a debt (liberare). The object of the delegans in
making 1116 delegation may be to give security to a creditor, orto
discharge his obligetion 1ο a creditor by giving him something
in lieu 61 payment (Solvit et qui reum delegat, Dig. 16, l, 8, 3), or
16166116631116131661611661661111111 party, 6116 make a 1666 16
him (Si 166. . . mutuam pecuniam rogaveris et ego meum debitorem
tibi promittere jusserim, Dig. 12, 1, 32), 61 any other object. In
1116 same way 1116 661 which Delegatus undertakes to do 161 the
third party may have for its object the discharge of a debt which 116
owee to Delegans, or gift, 611666, &a From 1111611166 been said it is
clear that there is no necessary connexion between delegation and
novation, and that delegatio may or may 661 1616116 novatio. It
does 66 only if delegatus makes a promise to delegatorius by which
66 6111361166 due from him to delegans is put an end 16, but where
the act to be performed is dare or liberare no new obligation arises,
so that there cannot, 61 666166, be any novation. But in the above
case of delegation (Inst 3, 26, 3),1116 debtor delegated 16 discharged
11661 his old debt to the person, who delegates him, by 66161166
(61 2 1 38), while the new creditor, to whom he is delegated, has not
only the action on the stipulation against him, but may 6166 666 the
Delegans by actio mandati contraria, 11 the 66116 ex stipulatu proves
abortivo. Hence in this way a creditor obtains security 161 his
debt, hie guaranty legally 61161113 661 from the delegatio 116611, but
from the contract 61 mandatum which accompanies it.

Givilians have drawn a distinction which we do not find in Roman
law between delegatio and assignatio, the latter being an order on
a person to paya sum to the assignatarius on the demand 61 the
latter, 6. 3. a cheque on a bank Until payment assignans has
6 power 6116161163 the order, and assignatus may, spart from any
contract with assignans, refuse to comply with the order; hence the
maxim: assignationis not payment. But when payment has once
been made, ithae the same effect as 11 11 had been made to assignans.

The Romans, no doubt, made great use 61 (1616361166 iucom-
mercial and other transactione, especially when these were conducted
by parties 616 distance from one another. We lrnow, e. 3., that
016616 pater supplied Cicero filius when a student at Athens with
money by the mediation of his friend Atticus who, as publican, had
debtors in Greece. The procedure would be as follows:

Atticus (A, 6661366161), 61 the request of Cicero pater (0, assigna·
161166 primus), orders Graeculus (Β, assignatus) to pay to Gicero
filius (D, assignatarius sccundus) what Atticus owes to Cicero pater.
'Phe payment by Graeculus to Assignatarius secundus, D, discharges
the debt of Graeculus to Atticus, the debt 61 Α111666 16 016616
