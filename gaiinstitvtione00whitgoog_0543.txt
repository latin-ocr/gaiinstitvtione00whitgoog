§ 42. The adjudicatio was only found in the three actione familiae
erciscundae, communi dividundo, and finium regundorum. It was
not a declaration 02 existing rights 02 property, but a partition of
property by a judex between the litigante. Adjudicatione dominium
nanciscimur. . . nam si judex u'ni ox heredibus aut sociis aut vicinis
rem aliquam adjudicaverit, statim illi adquiritur sive mancipi sive 1100
mancipi sit, Ulpian, 19,16. ‘Adjudication is ameans 02 acquiring
dominion, for the heir, partner, or neighbouring landowner‚ to whoma
thingisadjudieatedby thejudex,iorthwith acquiresownershiptherein,
whether itismanoipable ornot mancipable' Inquibustribusjudiciis
permittitur judici, rem alicui ex litigatoribus ex bono et aequo ad·
judicare, et, si unius pere praegravare videbitur, eum invicem certa
pecunia alteri condemnare, Inst 4, 6, 20. ‘In these three actions the
judge has the power to aseign a thing in accordance with fair-dealing
and equity to one of the litigante, and, 12 this one obtains more than

his share, to condemn him to make pecuniary compensation to the
othen’

5 43. Taxatio [signified by the word ‘dumtaxat ³] was a limitation
to the condemnatio, ξς 51, 52 3 cf. 3 ξ 224. Besides the kind notieed
here by Gaius, there were several others If a‘ paterfamilias was
sued ior the debt 02 0 person in his power whom he had authoriaed
to trado, the condemnation was limited to 2110 amount of the
peculium (quatenus in peculio eit); ifthe slave 01· 0011 had traded
without authority, it was limited to the amount of profit the father
or master had thereby received (quatenus in rem ejus versum sit),
ἕξ 72, 73; 22 the heir of a wrongdoer was eued, it was limited
to the amount that he gained from the wrong or fraud by his
succession (dumtaxat in id quod ad eum pervenit quanto locupletior
200200 est).

Again, in an analogous way, some debtors enjoyed a privilege that
is called Beneficium competentiaer the privilege of not being con-
demned to pay the whole amount 02 their debt but only such an
amount as will leave them the means 02 subsistenoe (condemnatio
in tantum quantum facere potest 0111101. 4, 6, 37, 38). Α soldier
