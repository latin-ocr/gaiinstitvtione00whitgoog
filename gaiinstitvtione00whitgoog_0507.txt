lv. §t 1-9.] ACTIONVM DIVISIO 447

advocated by an Adsertor, Ood. 7, 17, De adsertione tollenda. Under
the formulary system questions of status might be tried by a prae·
judicium, §44, which was regarded as a kind of actio in rem. We
have no record of the precise form of the intentio in this case.

A vindicatio asserting ownership in land contained an intentio
in these words: stiparet illum fundamen jure Quiritium Auli
Agerii (Plaintiff) csse. A vindicatio claiming not absolute property,
but some fraction of ownership (jus in re aliena), for instance, a rural
servitude, contained an intentio to this effect: Si paret Aulo Agerio
jus esse per fundum illurn ire agere, quanti ea res erit, dac, or, Si
paret Aulo Agerio jus esse aedes suas altius tollere invito Numerio
Negidio, quanti, dra, ξ 3. cf. ιι 92, 93.

Α Personal action, as we have seen, named in the intentio the
defendant, who was alleged to be under an obligation ιο the plaintiff.
a g. if the plaintiff alleged that the defendant lay under an obli·
gation to restore to him the thing he had lent him, the action was in
this form: Si paret Aulum Agerium Numerio Negidio rem de qua
agitur commodasse eamque Aulo Agerio redditam non esse, quanti
ea res erit, tantam pecuniam condemna, si non paret, absolve.

The word Dare is used in the Intentio of a condictio Oerti, i. e.
an action wherein the plaintiff asserta that the defendant is under
an obligation to convey quiritary property in a determinate thing,

· whether a sum of money or any other object oi property, acertain

slave, certain corn, certain land. E. g. Si paret Numerium Negidium
Aulo Agerio sestertium decem milia—tritici Africi optimi centum
modios—dare oportere. ¹

The word Facere never appears ιο stand alone in an intentio, but
in its stead we have Dare facere in the Intentio of actio ex stipulatu,
that is, of an action on a stipulation to enforce a claim of an
uncertain amount, a claim of any service but the transfer of quiri·
tary property in a certain thing, that is, ιο eniorce any obligation
not included under Dare as above defined. Eg. Quidquid paret
Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio dare facere oportere, ξ 5, comm.

Praestare is a term of wider meaning than the two preceding, and
appears specifically to denote reparatiou for any herm, compensation
for any loss, damages for breach oi any obligation other than liability
-dare-or dare facere. But some writers have tried ιο attach a
more definite meaning ιο the term. (ef. ltluirhead’s Gaius, 4 ξ 2.)
We find it is used in connexion with some arbitria and actions ex
fide bona, where the defendant's liability wasto be determined at
the discretiori of the arbiter or judex, In ali civil actions founded
on Deliet the intentio frequently contains the terme: damnum

decidere oportere, § 37, for which some writers think praestare tc
have been an equivalent
