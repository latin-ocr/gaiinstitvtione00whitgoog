(jus, in the special sense which it has in the phrases, suijuris, alieni
juris) ; he could only be an instrument by which his father acqnimd
arighi of command. Thus, filiusfamilias had commercium, and
could take by mancipatio, but the property he thus toolr vested in
his father3 he could make a valid contract, but the contractual
right vested in his father; he had testamentilactio, that is, ha could
be witness, libripens, familiae emptor, but he could not make a will,
ior he had no property to leave; ond if he took under a will as
legates or heir, the legacy or succeseion vested in his father: cf. 2
1 8⁷, 3 5 163,· comm. He hed the other clement of civitae, con·
nubium3 that is, he could contrait a civil marriage and beget civil
children3 but the patrie potestas over thess children tested not in
the father but in the grandfather, and if the' mtrrisge was accom-
pnnied with power oi hund (mande), marital power over the wile,
this vested not in the husband bnt in the husband's father. Any
property which thb eon was allowed by his father to manage was
called his peculium,¹ ie. was held on the same terme aa property
which a slave administered by permission of his proprietor. In
respect of debts which he incurred, the eon did not act es conduit
pipo, but (except ior a loan of money, which the Sc Macedohianum
made irrecoverable) was liable in hie own person, Dig. 44, 7, 39.
‘A eon under power incure obligation by the same titles, and may
be sued on the same grounds of action na an independent person?
'i'he nme rule applied to the son as to thb slave: Melior conditio
nostra per servm fieri potest, deterior fieri non potest, Dig. 50, 17,
133. ‘The melioration oi hls proprietor’s condition is in the power
oi a slave, but not the deteriorationi

In hia public functions, filiusfamilias was entirely beyond the
sphera of patria potestas. Quod ad jus publicum attinet non sequitur
jus potestatis, Digs 36, ly 14. Thus, a eon could act as praetor or
m judex in a suit to which his father was p party. He could
even preside ss magistrate over his own adoption or emancipation:
Si consul vel praeses filiusfamilias sit, posse eum apud semetipsum
vel emancipari vel in adoptionem dari constat, Dig. 1, 7, 3 (which
makes it doubtful how far political fimetions were suspended
everi by the state of mancipium or bohdagel. He could also
be appointed guardian (tutor), for guardianship (tutele) was held
to be e public fonction, Dig. 1, 6, 9. ‘A filiusfamilias in his public
relations is deamed independent, for ihstcnce, ae magistrate or as
guardian!

'l'he above-stated incapacities of filiusfamilias were subject, how·
ever, to certain exceptione and modificatione, which may now be
briedy considered.
