412 DE OBLIGATIONIBVS [111. 00183-2011

barbarous legislator supposed that detection in the 001 was an
aggravation 01 the 01101100, but because 110 wished, by the amplitude
01 the legal remedy offered, to induce 1110 aggrieved party not 10
take the law into hie own hands and inflict summary vongeanee on
the offender, particularly aa it was lawful 10 lrill a nocturnal thief,
or one who during the day defended himself with a weapon, Gell.
11, 18, 6, 7. In the infancy of society it ie an important object· to
the legislator to induce an injured person to have recourse to the
public tribunale instead 01 righting himself, that is to say, constituting
himself both langver and judge.

That such was really the motive 01 the legislator we have historio
evidence in the declaration 01 Rothan'e, ruler 01 the Langobards,
a. n. 643. He gives the relatives 01 the elain their electiori be·
tween the primitive vsngeance for blood (feud or vendetta) and a
composition or pecuniary fine (wergeld or poena) to be recovered
by action before the public tribunale. He says that he fixae a high
fine in order 10 induce plaintiffs 10 forgo their right of feud; and
implies that he would gladly have abolished 1110 right 01 feud or
private war, but felt that it was too deeply rooted in the habite 01
his tribe to be extirpated by legislation. Bethmanu·Hollweg, Der
Germ. (111. Ρ1οο000, 160.

Thia writer 00000000, Der Rom. O. P, §96, that the praetorisn
action Furti manifesti had a Fictitious formula, 4 1 32, and suggests
tho following:

Demorastrotio: Quod Numerius Negidius Aulo Agerio furtum
manifestum fecit paterae aureae,

Fictio: si obeam rem Numerium Negidium exlege verberari
itemque Aulo Agerio addici oporteret,

Ι Condemnatio: Quanti ea res fuit, tantae pecuniae, judex, Nume-
rium Negidium Aulo Agerio quadruplum condemnato: si non paret,
absolvito.

According to Gellius a slave 01101 having been scourged was
thrown from the Tarpeian rock, and some writers think that Gaius
stated this fact in 1110 above passage.

1 193. We must distinguish between furtum conceptum with ite
threefold penalty, 1 191, and furtum lance et licio conceptum. Ea
quoque furta quae per lancem liciumque concepte 0000111, proinde ac
ei manifesta 1010111, vindicaverunt, Gellius, 11, 18, 9. ‘Possession
of stolen goods discovered 011 search with the 0101101 and girdle was
punished ae 111011 detected in the act.' Cf. Inst. 4, 1, 4.

Traces of the word ‘conceptum’ occur in a fragment of the
Twelve Tables, vi, ⁷: Tignum junctum aedibus vineave 01 concapit
ne solvito, ‘Timber built into a house or vineyard of another man
and discovered there hythe owner must 1101 be severed :’ where et
