³ neptes-190] DE HEREDIBVS INSTITVEN DIS 225

An heir instituted in twelve ounces (ex asse) toolr the whole: but
it was a rule that no one could be partly temate and partly intestato,
and therefore if an heir were instituted in a part (ex parte) and
no other oobeir instituted, that part represented a pound‚ and the
heir took the whole. So if the shares allotted to several coheirs
amounted to more than twelve cuncos, then, if no other heir was
appointed with an unexpressed share, the as was deomed to consist
of more than twelve ounces, and each oo·heir took a ratable part of
the inheritance If one heir were instituted in a part, say ex besse,
and a cobeir were instituted for whom no part was expressed, then
the coheir would take the residue of the as, that is,would be deomed
to be instituted ex triente. But ifthe parts expressed lor certain

η heirs exhausted οι· exceeded the as and another heir or beirs were

named without express shares, then the whole inheritence was sup·
poeed to conciet of two asses (dupondius) and the expressed shores
were reduced to so many ounces out of twenty-four, the heir or heire
with unexpressed parts taking the residue. Similarly, ifnecesssry,
the inhesitance was supposed to consist of thirty-six ounces.

If the institution of one oo·heir lapsed, the shares of the remaining
cobeirs were ratably augmented (accretio), just as, if originally less
than twelve ounces had been distributed, the expressed eharss of
each would be ratably augmented so as to exhaust the inheritance. .

This rule, however, was modified by the leges caducarius, passed
chiefly to discourage eelibacy, namely the lex Julia de maritandis
ordinibus, s. n. 4, and the lex Papia Poppaea, on marriage and suc·
cession, Μ). 9, in which the provisions of the lex Julia were in·

corporated, for which reason both laws are sometimes referred to as

lex J ulia et Papia.
caducum is a devise or bequest, valid at Oivil law, but vacated by

some particular law or statute, such as a legacy to a celibate or Latinus
Junianus, in case the former fails within a hundred days to comply

’ with the law [the Lex Papia], or the latter to acquire full citizen·

sbip3 or in case of the institution of a oo·heir, or bequest to a legates
who dies or becomes an alien before the will is opened, Ulpian, 17, l.
[By the Civil law, unconditional devisas and bequests vested (dies
cedit) at the death of the testator (though still defeasible by the failure

'l'he leges caducarius, which fixed the conditione of caducity, were
aimed against the coelebs and the orbus. cf. §§ l 1 1, 144, 286. Coelebs
isdefined to be an unmarried man between the age of twenty and sixty,
or an unmarried woman between the age of twenty and fifty. Orbus
isa man between fifty and sixty without children, natural or adoptive.
