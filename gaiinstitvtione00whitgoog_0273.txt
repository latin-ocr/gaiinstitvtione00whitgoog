5152. The rules of institution and disinheritanee were formal
restrictione on the unlimited power of testamentary disposition, which
was conferred hythe terme of the Twelve Tables; ξ 102, comm. Tho
generrd tendency and purpose of these restrictione are to protect
children against the caprice of parents, and to be fully compre·
hended they should be viewed in connexion with the rules respecting
testamentum inofficiosum, which were not simply formal but real
restrictione of testamentary freedom. These limitatione of testa·
mentary power may be considered as consequences of the Roman
conception of family duty. An English metator hes unlimited
power to diepose of his property, and natural feeling is supposed
to be a sufficient guaranty that none of hie children will be left
without euitable provision. Of Roman testatore J ustinian says:
Inst 2, 18 pr. Plerumque parentes sine causa liberos suos vel.
exheredant vel omittunt The grounds on account of which parents
may dieinherit children, and children parents, are stated by J uetinian
in his neth Nou, where the law on the subject of disinherison is
consolidsted and amended. They had to be mentioned in the will,

and it was open to the disinherited person to show that they were s

unfounded. Itis to be noticed that foreign systems of law, following
the Roman example, generally restrict the father’e power of disin·
herison. cf. Sohm, 511³. The principal impedimenta to or restric-
tione on testamentary freedom in the history of Roman law may be
distinguished as follows :-

, (1) We have seen, i 123, that a suus heres must either be instituted
or disinherited, a rule which the praetor extended to an emancipeted
child, t 135. This secured him against being simply forgotten.

(ο) If a child was disinherited withouta cause, or received less than
one fourth, eitherasheir or legates, of what his share would have been
by intestate desoent (portio legitima), he could by impeaching the will
as iminoral or unnatural (querela inofficiosi testamenti) have it set
aeide on the fictitioue presumption of the testator’s insanity. The
presumption, at least, was so far fictitious that it was not allowed ιο
