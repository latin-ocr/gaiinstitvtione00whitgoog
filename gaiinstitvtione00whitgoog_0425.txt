metallic contente 01 the caah-box 01 arca at the end 01 the month
or year. This correspondeuce 01· agreement would he destroyed by
the introduction of Fiotitious loans (expensilatio) into the accounts,
unless every such entry to the credit 01 the cashier or chsst was
neutralized and cancelled bya eroes or opposite entry, 01 an equally
fictitious character, to the debit 01 the ehest or cashier. But 11
this device was adopted the balance 01 the book would coincide
with the actual contente 01 the chest3 and the fictitious entries
would he called Transscripticia because they were always double: ·
because each was always accompanied by its shadow across the
page. Verm. Schriften, 1, 205, 110.

In the time 01 Justinian both 01 the modes 01 Expensilatio,
properly confined to Roman citizens, though the Sabinians were
inclined to extend it in one form to aliens, § 133, had become
obsolete ; aa also another form 01 Literal contract, the Syngrapha
or chirographum, avallable where the parties were aliens. Syngrapha
and chirographum, apparently, are synonymous, and signify a
written ackuowledgment of a debt, such contract in Greece being
always ground 10 support an action, whatever its subject 01 form.
In the Corpus J uris the term Chirographum generally significa a
cautio or a document which is evidence 01 the existence or discharge
01 a deht, and the term Syngrapha occurs 111 the Greek Novellae of
Justinian in the same sense; cf. Sohm, p. 414, n. 3.

The desuetude oi Nomina transscriptioia was probably due, not
simply to the fact that the Roman system 01 book-keeping was
strange in the east, but also to the invention 01 consrrrurun, a
praetorian pact (pactum vestitum), which instead 01 converting, like
Expensilatio, an obligatior bonae fidei into an obligation stricti juris,
superadded an actionable obligation 10 a previous obligation, whether
natural or civil [Ubi quis pro alio constituit se soluturum, adhuc is
pro quo coustituit obligatus manet, Dig. 13, 5, 28, Inst 4, 6, 9] 3 and
which with its excessively penul sponsio, 4 ξ 171, gave the creditor
even n more effective remedy than the action on Expensilatio
(condictio for pecunia certa credita).

Arcarium nomen was the record, 110101 a fictitious loau, like
nomen transscripticium, but 01 the counting out of money from the
cashbox (arca), that is, ola genuine loan, and was, accordingly,
simply a memorandum 01 a Real obligation.

shows that entry in a Ledger did not operate a novation and convert
a debt into a ledger deht, unless the transcriptive entry represented
a fictitious, not an actual, loan. ’
