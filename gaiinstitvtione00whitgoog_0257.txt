grandchildren are not sui heredes to their grandfather at their birth,
bnt only by succession, that is bytho subsequent death of their
father, like those of the second chapter, Dig. 28, 2, 29, 15.

The following is a conspectus of the different kinds of Postumi
sui, i. a. descendants who after the making ofa will come into the
immediate power of a testator, whether (A) children or (B) grand·
children: to remoter descendants analogons principles will apply.

(A) children are either

(a) Veritably afterborn, that is to say born affer their father has
made his will, whether after their father's decease, in which case
the civil law treated them as certae personae, or in their fathcr’a
lifetime, in which case they form a subdivision of Velleiani primi
capitis:

(b) Or quasi-afterborn (loco postumorum), ie. quasisons or quasi·
daughters by adrogatio, adoptio, legitimatio, in manum conventio.

(c) Another quasi-afterborn ia the child who falls under the
immediate power of his soldier father, thetis, becomes his suus
heres, in consequence of the death of his grandfather, in whose
power he previously was, after his father had made awill of castrense
mulium: mg. ae, 2, aa, 1.

(Β) Afterborn grandchildren who, aa aelfsuccessors to their grand·
father, require institution or disinheritence in his will fall into four
classes, differentiated by the order of priority iu which certain events
occur, as hereunder indicated: ·

Posrurn Aournraur,

will of grandfather: Death of father: Death of grandfather:
Birth of grandchild.

Posrmrr Vamaram Psnar (tarmis,

Will of grandfather: Death of father: Birth of grandchild: Death
of grandfather.

Posrmu Sanum,

Will of grandfather: Birth of grandchild: Death of father: Death
of grandfather.

Posruar Vsnnasasr Saeuam Carme,

Birth of grsndchild: Will of grandfather: Death of father: Death
of grandfather.

The last two cases depend on the principle of successio. The
grandcbild is at birth in the power of his grandfather, but is not his
suus heres, so longas there is an intervening ascendant—the father-
in the sarm power. On the death of the intervening ascendant the
grandchild is said to succeed to his place, and beconms by such
succession suus berceto his grandfather.
