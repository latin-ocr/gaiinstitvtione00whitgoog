ii PREFACE

known for his writings on Roman eonstitutional history, and for
his speoial Treatises on ‘infamia’ and on ‘The Legal Prooedure
of Gioero’s Time.¹ 1

The text ofGaius adopted is that of the last edition of Krueger ³

and Studemund, which its German proprietors have again most f
kindly allowed us to use. In this text the numerous laounae ;
are only filled up, where from passages in the Institutas or other l
souroes the missing words may be inserted, at least with a very ἕ

high degree of probability. Some other oonjeetural readings,
more or less followed in the Translation‚ will be found in the
Appendix. It is to be hoped that in some future edition of
this book aCritioal Apparatus may be supplied hya competent
hand. ln the meantime the student should more espeoially refer
to the notes on the text appended to Krueger’s and Studemund's
Gaius. He may also oonsult with advantage the notes to the

late Professor Muirhead’s edition of Gaius, though the valuable .

textual oritioism to be found there requires revision in thelight

of more recent researoh.

, ln oonolusion‚I have to express my obligations to my old
friend and pupil Mr. Ledlie, the translator of Sohm’s I warato,

for many helpful suggestions. Another old friend and pupil,

Dr. Potts, hae also rendered me valuable aid, especially in the
preparation of the Index and of the Chronologioal Tabia. My
friends Dr. Sohuster and Dr. Greenidge have given me useful

ipformation on several points about whioh 1 have oonsulted
t em.
