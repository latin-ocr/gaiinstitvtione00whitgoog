lle can be sued for the value of the fruits he hae neglected to guther
(tructus neglecti) only in the prinoipal vindicatio: their non-existence
preventa hie being sued for thamin a separate vindicati0; and the

tt 66·69. Occupation gives property in a thing which previously
bas no owner. Quod enim ante nullius est id naturali ratione
occupanti conceditur, Inst 2, 1, 12. Ii a thing had already an
owner, it is only aiter dereliction by him that it can be appropriated
by occupation. Dereliction, or renunciation oi ownership, requires

= both the intention to abendon it and an external action. Thus the

tasting overheard oi articles in a tempost to lighten a ship is not

³ dereliction, as there is no intention of abandoning the property in

the event of salvage, lust. 2, 1, 48. Nor does the mere intention of
abandonment constitute dereliction oi owncrship without a throwing
away or removal or some other external act; and hersin dereliction of
ownerahip differs from dereliction of possession, which does not require
this second element. Differentia inter dominium et possessionem
haecest, quod dominium nihilo minus ejus manet qui domiuus esse non
vult, possessio autem recedit ut quisque constituit nolle possidere,
hig. tl, 2, 17. ‘There is this difference between ownership and posses·
sion, that ownership continues aiter the will to own has censeri,
whereas possemion cesses with the cessation of the will to possess!

drawn. In those ol them that are half tamed (mansuefactae), among
which are mentioned deer, peacocks, pigeone, bees, property isnot
limited by strict detention, as in other wild animale, but by animus
revertendi. A migrating swarm (examen) of bees, accordingly,
would only continue to belong to the owner ol the hive as long as
it continues in his sight and is easy to recepturo, as ithae no
intention of returning. In tame animale, e. g. dogs or gesse, the
rights oi the owner are not extinguished by their straying without
ur intention to return„ Inst. 2, 1, 12-16.

§tit-79. 'Phe intimate conjunction of two things, so that they
are no longer separabis and restorable to their former condition,
may produce a transmutation of ownership A separable junction,
as when two flochs of sheep are intermingled, or when a stone is
flet in a ring, or when two metals are soldered together (plumbatum),
01 when the grain of one man is mixed with that oi another, spart
from an agreement to share in common, produces no change ol
ownership. In one case, however, namely, when material has been

used in building a house on another man’s land, although the pro·
