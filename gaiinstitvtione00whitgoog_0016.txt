The history of Roman Law begins forus with the traditione that

have been preserved conceming the Roman Monarchy. The exist-
ence ofa Monarchy such as that described-for us by annalists like
Livy and Dionysius, implies the existence of.a consolidated State,
with a central legislative and executive power and a tolerably
uniform system of law. In the Monarchy, however, and even 111 the
early Republic it seems that the system of law was not marked by
perfect uniformity, since the two classes 01 Patricians and Plebeians,
which made up the Roman State, appear to have been distinguished,
not only by the possession of different political privileges, but also by
the possession of different systems of customary law ¹. Itis even
Ι possible that a further divergenee of practice may have existed in
the most primitive society, or societies, o'ut of which the Gity and
Monarchy 01 Rome developed-that a considerable amount 01
autonomy in legal relations may have existed in the Clans (Gentes)
and Villages (Vici), out of which the earliest Rome was formed.

'rho history of Roman law, from its beginning to its close, would · .

thus be marked by 0 process of gradually increasing unification.
First the custorns of the Olane vvere merged in the customs of a
State; but this State consisted of two classes, Patricians and
Plebeians 3 and each 01 these classes seems to have had a customary
law of its own. Then an attempt was made to create a uniform
system ; and this uniformity was probably secured by making
patrician law approximate as closely as possible to plebeian-the
law of the few to the lavv of the many. A further advance was
made when Rome had become the mistress of Italy. Italian
eustoms were made ultimately to conform 10 those of the leading
State, and the free citios of Italy became the municipalities of Rome.
Lastly, Rome had created an Empire. For a very long period she
adopted the wise and cautious policy of recognizing, asfar as possible,
the local and tribal law of the citics and peoples under har control.
The recognition 01 this local or tribal law was 1101, however, merely
a symptom of the favourite Roman principle of non-interference. Ii
was also a sign that the privileges of Romans and Italians were not
possessed by provincials; for the conforment 01 Roman citizenship,
or even oi Latin rights, necessarily carried with it the use of the forms
01 Roman Privata Law ². Hence, when a time came at which Rome
was willing 10 raise States or individuale 111 110 Provinees to a level

1111110111 possessed commercium and some 01 110111 martium. 11111Ιοί11100-
ship would also be possessed by a considerable class in Latin towns, i. e. by all
who, through holding a magistracy, had become Roman citizens.
