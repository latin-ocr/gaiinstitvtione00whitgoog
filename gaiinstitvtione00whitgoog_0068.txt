of issuing certain administrativa decrees or instructions to magistrates
that was hardly distinguishable from legislation. Under the
emperors matters were changed. Legislation by the Comitia,
though spoken of by Gaius in the present tense, had ceased to be
areality alter the time of Tiberius, and the last recorded lex was
passed in the reign of Nerva. As early astho time of Augustus the
auctoritas oi the senate began to be regarded as the essential process
in making a law, and the subsequent rogationi the Comitia as a
more formality, which was· finally omitted. senatusconsulta, like
lawe, were sometimes named aiter the consuls who proposed them,
though this is not in their csse an official designation; they are
' sometimes even called leges: thus the measure which Gaius calls
Sc. Claudianum, ξ 84, is subsequently referred to by him under the
name of lex, ξ 157, 4 §5 85, 86. Ulpian says, Non ambigitur senatum
jus facere posse, Dig. l, ³, 9. Of course, these senatusconsulta were
merely a disguised form of imperial constitution. The sovereigirty
had in fact passed from both patriciana and plebeians to the hands
of the princeps. A measure was recommended by the emperor in an
oratio or epistola to the senate, and then proposed by the consul
who convoked the senate, and voted by the senate without opposi-
tion. Hence a senatusconsult is sometimes called oratio, s. g. oratio
divi Marci, Dig. 2, 12, 1 pr. Even this form was finally disused.
No senatusconsult relat-ing to matters of civil law occurs aiter the
time oi Septimius Severus.

ξ 5. Although when caius wrote the emperor had not yet acquired
the formal right of making statutas, his supreme caecutire power
enabled him to give to his constitutions the same force as if they
had been leges. The legal origin aad character of the different
¹forms of imperial constitution has been much controverted, and
certainly varied at different periods.

Edicta were legislative ordinances issued by the emperor in virtue
of the jurisdiction appertaining to him as highest magistrate, and
amre analogous to the edicte of the praetore and aediles. In the
time of Gaius they had only binding force during the life ol the
emperor who issued them, requiring the confirmation of his successor
ior their continuing validity3 but from the reign ol Diocletian,
when the empire assumed an autocratic lorm, their duration oeased
to be thus limited.

Decreta were judicial decisione made by the emperor as the
highest appellate tribunal: or in virtue of his magisterial juris·
diction, and analogous to the extraordinaria cognitio of the
praetor. .

Epistolae or rescripta were answcrs to inquiries addressed to the
emperor by private parties or by judges. They may be regarded as
