174 DE ADQVIRENDO RERVM DOMINIO [11. qq 86-96.

only admitted when the representative was in an inferior status to
the principal, was his slave, or subject to his potestas, manus, cr
mancipium, § 95. This limitation was found to be inconvenient,
when, in the progress of Roman conquest, Roman citizens became
proprietors in remote parts ol the world; and Possession was

1 allowed to be acquirable by the instrumentality of extranea persona,

that is, of a person who stood in no relation of inferiority to the
acquirer, which though a doubtful point in the time of Gaius, was
finally settled by a constitution of the Emperor Severus. In a civil
solemnity, like mancipation, a man could not be represented by an
independent agent3 but when the transfer of possession (traditio)
became a mode and ultimately the universal mode of transferring
dominion, it followed thatOwnershiptdominium),aswellssPossession,
could be acquired by the agency of libera persona, if the person making
traditio ofa thing to the agent was himself owner of it, Inst 2, 5.

The acquisition of Obligations or personat rights by brokerage of
an independent agent was less perfectly developed. In fact Roman
law adhered throughout its history to the rule that sn agent could only
contract rights for himself and not for his principat, though means
were taken to circumvent this restrictiori as far as possible. The
process employed for this purpose was a duplication oi the relation of
agency (mandatum). A as principa] (dominus) appointed B his agent
(procurator). B then contracted witha third party in his own name,
and, in order to transfer the benefit of his contract to Α, he eeded
to him his right of action, that is to say, B, as principal, in his turn
made A his agent (procurator in rem suam), whereby A was eble to
sue in the name of B, aud obtain judgement on his own account.
Finslly, the praetor ellowed the principal to sue immediately, with·
out an express mandate, if intention to assign was shown, by bringing
a utilis actio, 3 § 163, comm.

§eu We might have expected that, as those subject to potestas
can acquire for their superiora by Mancipatio, ξ 87, so they could also
acquire by In jure cessio, especially as the seme form of words-
Hunc ego hominem ex jure Quiritium meum esse aio—was used in
Mancipatio, 15119, and in Vindicatio, 4§ 16. It seems, however, that
in Mencipatio the formula could be changed to Hanc rem ex jure
Quiritium Lucii Titii domini mei esse aio, 3 ξ 167 ; and thata similar
modification was not admissible in in jure cessio. It follows that
an inferior (filius, qui in mancipio est, or servus) could acquire for
his superior rural servitudes, but not urban or personal servitudes,
ξς 29, 30, these being only created by in jure cessio; not, that is to
say, as res singulae: for as parts of a rerum universitas these and all
other rights could be acquired for a superior byan inferior by making
aditio of an hereditas with the sanction of the superior, § 188 ; and
