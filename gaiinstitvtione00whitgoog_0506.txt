sacramenti actione petitur. (See Muirhead’s Gaius, h. l.) In either
case the olassification would involve a co·ordination of subgenera
and genera, or subdivisione and divisione.

A Real action, t 3, is one which asserta a jus in rem, e Persoual
action, t 2, one which assorts a jus in personam. A jus in rem, we
may remember‚ is a right to certain forbearances or heodem from
molestation‚ corresponding to a duty imposed on all the world: a
jus in personam ie a right to certain performances or forbearances
corresponding to a duty imposed on a determinate person. J ura in
rem, which are rights oi property, are Ownership‚ and jura in re
aliena, such as Servitude, that is, some irsotion of ownership,
Emphyteusis, and Pignus. J ura in personam ane Obligations founded
on either contraot or delict, or some quasicontract or quasidelict.

A Real action, accordingly, asserts either the ownership (hunc
hominem meum esso aio) of the plaintiff or one ol the jura in re
aliena above mentioned; aPersonal action asseris au obligation ol
the defendant towards the plaiutiff.

In Roman law, it should be remembered‚ aolaim of property in
a movable is a Real action just as much aa a claim oi property in an
immovable. Thus the distinction between Real and Personal actions
which we meet with in the history of English law divergod widely
from its Roman prototype.

A Real action or actio in ram when carried on in the form of legis
actio sacramento, § 16, contained an assertion by each party of his
claim to the thing not as against tho other party to the suit, but
absolutely—Hunc ego fundum ex jure Quiritium meum esse aio, dra,
and similarly in the formulary procedure a real action names no
party but the Plaintiff in the intentio, the principal part of the
formula or written instructions ol the praetorto the judex, in which
the plaintiff’s claim is speoified ; e. g. Si paret hominem quo de agitur
ex j ure Quiritium Auli Agerii esee 3 whereas a Personal action names
the defendant as well as the plaintiff in the intentio, e. g. si paret
’ Numerium N egidium Aulo Agerio H. S. decem milia dare oportere.

A vindicatio originally in the form oi legis actio &cremento in
rem, in which the striking the slave with the vindicta or wand was
retained, survived in the injure cessio used for the purpose ol
manumission (vindicatio in libertatern), aud also in the form of
adoption, cf. 1 § 134-is qui adoptat vindieat apud praetorem filium
suum esse, et illo contra non vindicante a praetore vindicanti filius
addicitur. Trials concerning status were, we know, carried on in
the decemviral court by process of legis actio till the time ol
Augustus. We know that in a question of libertas (liberalis causat,
until the time of Justinian, tho person whose freedom was in dis-

pute could not be either plaintiff or defendant, his rights were Ἴ
