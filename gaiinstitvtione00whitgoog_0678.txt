The party against whom judgment was given in interdict procedure
was, it would seem, technically guilty 01 having disobeyed the mandate
contained in the 1111411141 01 the magistrate. interdict procedure,
which was carried 01 by means 01 4 sponsio poenalis, 1144 in some 14
specta 11014 similarity to a delictal than to astrictly civil action. That
some interdicte in particular (interdictum fraudatorium, interdictum
de vi, 4111111411) were classed with actions ex delicto, appears 11411
the fact that they were only maintainable against the wrongdoer
within a year 11411 their nativity, though originally this was other·
wisa in the case 41 the interdictum de vi armata, cis. ad Fam. 15, 161
411 were only maintainable against the heir 01 the wrong-dost so far
as he was enriched hythe wrong 01 his predecessor (quatenus ad eum
pervenit . . . 11141141 lucrum ei extorqueatur, Dig. 44, 7, 35, pn),
features which the interdicte have in common with other unilaterally
penalactions. Moreover‚ the interdicta retinendae possessionis appear
14 have been based, 44 114 have seen, on an act 01 1411141 violence (114
ex conventu), that is ou an 441 01 4 14114141 kind.

'Phe right of a person who hae been dispossessed to he reinststed

cording to Savigny it was the right 014 neeman to be exempt 11411

He denies, that is, that the mere fact ot Posaessiou can give a title
investing the possessor who, it is to be remembered, may even he
a thief or other mala fide possessor, with a right to continue in pce

that the object 01 the 110144444111 1114111414, whatever may be their

it he finds 111001 01 his possession, which is all that the interdicta
require—a much easier task than proot 01 ownership, which is 1111
verbially difficult. This advantage, however, cannot be given him.
unless it is 4140 41141141 10 the possessor who is not owner, and even
to the 1114141114 possessor, since otherwise the question 41 11104101

11114 would not be avoided.
